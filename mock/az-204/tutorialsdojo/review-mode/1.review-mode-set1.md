> 👉🏻 **Explanation**
>
> **✅ The Answer:**
>
> - **List → Maintain a queue of tasks to process user-generated requests in the order they are received.**
> - **Channel → Implement a publish/subscribe mechanism for real-time notifications.**
> - **Set → Store unique user roles efficiently to prevent duplication.**
>
> ---
>
> **🤔 Why This Is the Best Answer:**
>
> Redis Provide a lot of data structure types each one for its specific purpose
>
> - **List** works like a queue (FIFO or LIFO), making it ideal for handling tasks sequentially in the order they were generated.
> - **Channel** enables a **pub/sub** model, perfect for broadcasting real-time notifications between distributed application components.
> - **Set** guarantees uniqueness, which is crucial for storing roles, tags, or IDs without duplicates.
>
> These match exactly with the question’s requirements for **queuing**, **real-time messaging**, and **role management**.
>
> ---
>
> **❌ Why Other Options Are Wrong:**
>
> - **Sorted Set:** While it supports ordered elements with scores (useful for leaderboards or priority queues), the scenario does not require scoring or ranking—only a simple task queue, which **List** handles better.
> - **Hash:** Useful for structured objects (e.g., user profiles with multiple fields), but it does not enforce uniqueness (like **Set**) or ordered task handling (like **List**), nor does it support messaging.
>
> 👉 Correct matches are **List, Channel, and Set**, not **Sorted Set** or **Hash**.

> 👉🏻 **Explanation**
>
> **✅ The Answer:**
>
> - Active Directory Integrated authentication mode
>
> **📖 Explanation:**
>
> - Microsoft Entra ID provides centralized management for the identities of both individuals and services within your data estate. By integrating it with Azure SQL for authentication, you can streamline identity and access management while gaining enhanced conditional access controls and governance over all data connections.
> - To enable the Active Directory Integrated authentication mode, an on-premises Active Directory instance linked to Microsoft Entra ID in the cloud is required. Federation can be achieved using tools such as Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS).
> - With this mode, users signed in to a domain-joined machine can access Azure SQL data sources seamlessly without credential prompts. However, you cannot include a username and password in the connection string for .NET Framework applications. For .NET Core and .NET Standard applications, including a username in the connection string is optional. Additionally, the Credential property of the SqlConnection cannot be configured when using this mode.

> **❌ Why Other Options Are Wrong:**
>
> - **Active Directory Interactive authentication** is incorrect because it requires user interaction and prompts for authentication each time. This contradicts the requirement to minimize authentication prompts. It is typically used when Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is required.
>
> - **Microsoft Entra ID tokens** is incorrect because token-based authentication is primarily used for applications and services, not for direct user authentication through SSMS. It does not allow seamless authentication for users without manual intervention.
>
> - **SQL Server Authentication** is incorrect because it requires a username and password to be entered manually for every connection. It does not support integration with Microsoft Entra ID or on-premises Active Directory, making it unsuitable for the given requirements.
