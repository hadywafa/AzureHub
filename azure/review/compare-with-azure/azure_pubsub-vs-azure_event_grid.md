# 📨 Azure PubSub vs Azure Event Grid

Azure Web PubSub and Azure Event Grid both deal with messaging, but they serve very different architectural roles. Let’s break it down clearly:

## ⚖️ Azure PubSub vs Azure Event Grid

| Feature                | **Azure Web PubSub**                      | **Azure Event Grid**                                |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| 🔄 Communication Model | Real-time, bi-directional (WebSocket)     | Event-driven, one-way (push notifications)          |
| 🧠 Purpose             | Live updates to/from clients (e.g., chat) | Event routing between services (e.g., blob created) |
| 📡 Protocol            | WebSocket, MQTT                           | HTTP POST (event schema)                            |
| 🎯 Target Audience     | Frontend clients (browsers, apps)         | Backend services (Functions, Logic Apps, etc.)      |
| 🧵 Statefulness        | Persistent connection (WebSocket)         | Stateless event delivery                            |
| 🔐 Security            | Connection tokens, user groups            | Event subscriptions, filters                        |

## 🧠 When to Use Each

### ✅ Use **Azure Web PubSub** when:

- You need **real-time updates** to clients (e.g., dashboards, chat apps, multiplayer games).
- You want **bi-directional communication** (clients can send messages too).
- You don’t want to manage WebSocket servers or scaling.

### ✅ Use **Azure Event Grid** when:

- You want to **react to events** in Azure (e.g., blob uploaded, resource created).
- You need to **trigger workflows** (e.g., Azure Functions, Logic Apps).
- You’re building **event-driven microservices** or automation pipelines.

## 🔧 Example Use Case Comparison

| Scenario                            | Best Fit   |
| ----------------------------------- | ---------- |
| Live stock ticker dashboard         | Web PubSub |
| Notify backend when blob is added   | Event Grid |
| Real-time collaborative whiteboard  | Web PubSub |
| Trigger function on VM creation     | Event Grid |
| Chat app with user groups           | Web PubSub |
| Fan-out events to multiple services | Event Grid |

## 🧠 Portfolio Tip

If you're building a **real-time frontend**, use **Web PubSub**.  
If you're building a **reactive backend**, use **Event Grid**.

They can even work together:

- Event Grid triggers a Function → Function pushes update via Web PubSub → Client receives it live.
