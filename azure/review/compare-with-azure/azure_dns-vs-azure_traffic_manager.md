# **Azure Traffic Manager** vs **Azure DNS**

## üß≠ Azure DNS: Domain Name Resolution

**Purpose:** Host and manage DNS records for your domains.

- **Functionality:** Resolves domain names (e.g., `api.hady.dev`) to IP addresses.
- **Use Case:** You want to manage DNS zones and records (A, CNAME, TXT, etc.) within Azure.
- **Scope:** Pure DNS service‚Äîno traffic routing logic.
- **Integration:** Works seamlessly with other Azure services like App Services, VMs, and Azure Front Door.
- **Pricing:** Based on number of zones and DNS queries.

## üö¶ Azure Traffic Manager: DNS-Based Traffic Routing

**Purpose:** Route incoming traffic to the best endpoint based on routing rules.

- **Functionality:** Uses DNS responses to direct users to optimal endpoints (e.g., closest region, healthiest service).
- **Routing Methods:** Priority, Performance, Geographic, Weighted, Subnet, MultiValue.
- **Use Case:** You want high availability, geo-distribution, or failover across multiple endpoints.
- **Scope:** Operates at the DNS layer but adds traffic management intelligence.
- **Limitations:** Doesn‚Äôt see actual HTTP traffic‚Äîonly DNS queries. No sticky sessions.

---

## üß© How They Work Together

- **Azure DNS** hosts your domain and resolves names.
- **Traffic Manager** acts as a smart DNS responder, returning different IPs based on routing logic.
- Example: `api.hady.dev` is hosted in Azure DNS, and Traffic Manager routes users to the best regional backend.

Perfect‚Äîlet‚Äôs bridge your AWS experience to Azure with a direct mapping. Think of it like this:

## üß≠ Azure DNS ‚âà Route 53 (Basic DNS)

- **Azure DNS** is like the DNS hosting part of **Amazon Route 53**.
- It lets you manage DNS zones and records (A, CNAME, MX, etc.) for your domains.
- No routing logic‚Äîjust pure name resolution.

---

## üö¶ Azure Traffic Manager ‚âà Route 53 (Traffic Policies)

- **Azure Traffic Manager** is like the **traffic policy/routing features** of Route 53.
- It uses DNS responses to route users to different endpoints based on:
  - **Priority** (failover)
  - **Performance** (lowest latency)
  - **Geographic** (regional control)
  - **Weighted** (load balancing)
- It doesn‚Äôt inspect HTTP traffic‚Äîjust DNS-level routing.

| Feature                  | AWS (Route 53)           | Azure Equivalent                |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------ | ------------------------------- |
| DNS Zone Hosting         | Route 53 Hosted Zones    | Azure DNS                       |
| DNS Record Management    | Route 53 Records         | Azure DNS                       |
| Traffic Routing Policies | Route 53 Traffic Flow    | Azure Traffic Manager           |
| Health Checks            | Route 53 Health Checks   | Azure Traffic Manager (limited) |
| Global Failover          | Route 53 + Traffic Flow  | Azure Traffic Manager           |
| HTTP-Level Routing       | **AWS CloudFront / ALB** | **Azure Front Door**            |

## üß† Pro Tip for Your Portfolio

If you're building a modular project with multi-region APIs or dashboards:

- Use **Azure DNS** to host your domain.
- Use **Traffic Manager** to route users to the best backend (e.g., UAE vs Germany).
- For HTTP-level routing, caching, and WAF, layer **Azure Front Door** on top‚Äîlike CloudFront + ALB.
