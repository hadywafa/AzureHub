# Queue Storage

Azure Queue Storage facilitates a reliable messaging system that decouples the communication between various components in a cloud service. This is particularly useful **when the front-end generates requests at a faster pace than the back-end can process**. The queue holds these messages until they can be processed, ensuring smooth operations and effective workflow management.
