# Problems

## 📌 Scenario 1

- A file was deleted **and committed**.
- Work continued after that, so we **cannot revert the whole commit** (it would undo other people’s work).
- Instead, we need to **bring back just that deleted file** without affecting other history.

---

### 🛠 Correct Steps

**STEP 1 → `git log`:**

- Find the commit hash **before the deletion** (the last commit where the file existed).
- Example:

  ```bash
  git log -- path/to/file
  ```

  Output shows commit hashes → pick the last good one.

---

**STEP 2 → `git restore --source [hash] path/to/file`:**

- Use the commit hash to restore only that file from history.
- Example:

  ```bash
  git restore --source abc123 path/to/file
  ```

  This brings back the file to your working directory.

_(Alternatively, `git checkout [hash] -- path/to/file` works too, but `git restore` is modern Git syntax.)_

---

**STEP 3 → Commit the restored file:**

- Stage and commit the restored file without touching other code.

  ```bash
  git add path/to/file
  git commit -m "Restore deleted file"
  ```

---

### ✅ Final Answer Order

1. `git log`
2. `git restore --source [hash] path/to/file`
3. (implicit commit step, but since given options are fixed, you just pick restore as the recovery command)

---

### ❌ Why Not Other Options?

- **`git branch backup`** → unrelated, makes a new branch.
- **`git revert HEAD~1 --no-edit`** → reverts the _entire commit_, would break newer changes.
- **`git checkout [hash]~1 -- path/to/file`** → older style, works too, but less preferred than `git restore`.

---

👉 So the clean 3-step process:
**`git log` → `git restore --source [hash] path/to/file` → commit\`**
