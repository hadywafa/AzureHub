# 🧨 **Interview Question: How to Remove a Feature That Was Merged into `main`**

## 🧪 Situation

You’ve merged a feature branch (e.g., `feature/login`) into `main`, but now you've realized:

> "Oops! That feature is buggy or shouldn’t have been merged. How do I remove it from `main`?"

The answer **depends on how it was merged.**

---

```ini
But what if we added new commits and merged them into `main` and after a while we figured out that there is a bug commit we need to remove it?
```

## 🔍 Strategy Based on Merge Type

### 🧱 1. **If merged using `--no-ff` (merge commit)**

You’ll have a **merge commit** on `main` that includes all the feature work. In this case, you can **revert the merge commit** using:

```bash
git revert -m 1 <merge_commit_hash>
```

#### 📌 Explanation:

- `-m 1`: Specifies the **mainline parent** (usually `main`)
- This creates a **new commit** that undoes everything introduced by the feature branch

✅ **Safe**  
✅ Keeps history  
❌ Doesn’t remove the old commits, just adds a “reversal” commit

---

### 🍔 2. **If merged using Squash Merge**

This created **a single commit** (e.g., `F`) in `main` that represents all changes.

To remove it:

```bash
git revert <commit_hash_of_F>
```

✅ Simple  
✅ Clean  
❌ Original branch commits (C–D–E) still exist in the repo (not on `main`)

---

### 🧼 3. **If merged using Rebase and Fast-Forward**

This means the feature branch commits (`D` and `E`) were **replayed directly onto `main`**, one by one.

To remove them:

```bash
git revert <commit_D_hash>
git revert <commit_E_hash>
```

Or revert in batch using a range:

```bash
git revert <start_hash>^..<end_hash>
```

❌ Tedious for large PRs  
✅ Reverts each individual commit, good audit trail

---

### 🚨 4. **If you want to hard-remove the commits**

> ⚠️ Only do this if you're _really sure_ and working in a **private repo or protected branch is turned off**.

You can use **Git reset**:

```bash
git reset --hard <commit_before_merge>
git push --force
```

❌ Destroys history  
❌ Dangerous on shared branches  
✅ Clean rollback if no one else pulled it yet

## 🧾 Summary Table

| Merge Type       | Safe Reversal Method                    | Destroys History | Keeps Commit History |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------- | ---------------- | -------------------- |
| Merge Commit     | `git revert -m 1 <merge_commit>`        | ❌               | ✅                   |
| Squash Commit    | `git revert <squashed_commit>`          | ❌               | ✅                   |
| Rebase + FF      | `git revert <each_commit>`              | ❌               | ✅                   |
| Reset (any type) | `git reset --hard <old_commit>` + force | ✅               | ❌                   |

## 🔁 Merge vs Rebase – What’s the Real Difference?

### 🆚 Conceptual Difference

| Feature      | `git merge`                                | `git rebase`                                   |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **Behavior** | Combines branches using a **merge commit** | Moves commits from one branch **onto another** |
| **History**  | Keeps branch history + commit graph splits | Linearizes history (no branch splits)          |
| **Commits**  | Doesn’t change commit hashes               | **Rewrites** commit hashes                     |
| **Safety**   | Safe for shared branches                   | Unsafe if rebased branch was already pushed    |
| **Use case** | For preserving history                     | For clean, linear history                      |

---

### 🔁 Merge: Think of it like **combining timelines**

```bash
main:     A --- B --- C ----------- M
                       \\          /
feature:                D --- E ---
```

- `M` is a **merge commit** with 2 parents
- Easy to audit where features came from

---

### 🔁 Rebase: Think of it like **editing the past**

```bash
Before:
main:     A --- B --- C
                       \\
feature:                D --- E

After:
main:     A --- B --- C --- D' --- E'
```

- Clean, linear
- But risky: rewrites history

### 🧪 Analogy Time!

| Action | Analogy                                                                |
| ------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Merge  | Combining two roads at a **roundabout** (history shows both paths)     |
| Rebase | Taking one road and **paving it directly over the other** (clean path) |

---

## 🔥 Final Tip for Interviews

If asked **“which should you use?”**, answer:

> “It depends on the team’s policy. I prefer rebase for a clean, linear history on local branches and squash for PRs. But if audit trails or traceability are critical, I use merge commits.”

✅ Shows thoughtfulness and real-world experience.
