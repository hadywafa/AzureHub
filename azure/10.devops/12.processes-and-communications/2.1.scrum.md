# 🏉 What is Scrum?

Scrum is a **way of working** (a framework) that helps teams build software (or any product) in **small pieces**, instead of trying to deliver everything at once.

- Instead of 1 big release after months → you deliver **usable chunks** every 2–4 weeks.
- It’s like cooking dinner 🍲: instead of preparing the entire meal and serving it at the end, you serve small dishes one by one, and guests can give feedback while you’re cooking.

👉 Scrum is based on **Agile principles** (fast, adaptive, customer-focused).

## 🎭 Scrum Roles (Who is in Scrum?)

1. **Product Owner (PO)**

   - Decides _what to build_.
   - Manages the **Product Backlog** (a prioritized list of features).

2. **Scrum Master**

   - Ensures the team follows Scrum properly.
   - Removes blockers, facilitates meetings, protects the team.

3. **Development Team**

   - The actual builders (devs, testers, designers, etc.).
   - They decide _how_ to build and deliver the work.

## 📦 Scrum Artifacts (What do they use?)

1. **Product Backlog** 📝

   - A big shopping list of everything the product needs.
   - Managed by the Product Owner.
   - Items are called **User Stories** (or in Azure DevOps, PBIs = Product Backlog Items).

2. **Sprint Backlog** 🎯

   - A smaller list pulled from the Product Backlog.
   - What the team commits to deliver in the current Sprint.

3. **Increment** 🚀

   - The actual working product delivered at the end of a Sprint.
   - Should be potentially shippable (something you could release to users).

## ⏳ Scrum Events (How does the team work?)

Scrum runs in **Sprints** (short cycles of 2–4 weeks).

Inside each Sprint:

1. **Sprint Planning**

   - The team + PO decide what work will be done in this Sprint.
   - Output = Sprint Backlog.

2. **Daily Scrum (Daily Standup)**

   - A 15-min daily meeting.
   - Each member says: _What I did yesterday, what I’ll do today, what’s blocking me_.

3. **Sprint Review**

   - At the end of the Sprint, team shows the **working product** to stakeholders.
   - Stakeholders give feedback.

4. **Sprint Retrospective**

   - Team reflects on **how they worked**.
   - What went well? What can we improve for next Sprint?

## 📊 Scrum in Azure DevOps

When you create a project in Azure DevOps and select **Scrum process**:

- Product Backlog → **PBIs (Product Backlog Items)**.
- Sprint Backlog → selected PBIs + Tasks.
- Scrum ceremonies are mapped to **Azure Boards → Sprints**.

👉 In Azure DevOps, Scrum just changes the **naming** of work items (User Stories vs PBIs), but the flow is the same.

## ✅ Quick Recap for Beginners

- Scrum = a way to work in **short cycles (Sprints)**.
- Roles: **PO** (what to build), **Scrum Master** (coach), **Dev Team** (builders).
- Artifacts: **Product Backlog**, **Sprint Backlog**, **Increment**.
- Events: **Sprint Planning, Daily Scrum, Sprint Review, Retrospective**.
- Goal: Deliver **small, working product increments** fast and improve continuously.
