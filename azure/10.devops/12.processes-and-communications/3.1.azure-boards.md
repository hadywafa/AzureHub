# 🗂️ Azure DevOps Boards – The Engine of Agile 🚦

_Azure Boards is an **agile work tracking tool** inside Azure DevOps for **planning, tracking, and discussing work** across teams._

---

> 📖 **Official Definition**:  
> Azure Boards is a web-based service that enables teams to plan, track, and discuss work across the entire development process, while it supports agile methodologies. Azure Boards provides a customizable platform for managing work items, allowing teams to collaborate effectively and streamline their workflow.

It’s like **Jira**, but native to Azure DevOps — perfect if you’re already using Azure Repos, Pipelines, or Test Plans.

| **Azure Boards Feature** | **Function / Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **📰 Work Items**        | Access lists of work items based on criteria like assigned to you, followed items, or ones you viewed/updated.                                                                                                                                                |

| **🔍 Queries**           | Generate custom work item lists and perform various tasks, such as triage work, make bulk updates, and view relationships between work items. Queries also allow for creating status and trend charts that can be added to dashboards.                        |
| **📅 Delivery Plans**    | Calendar view of work items across teams and sprints. Aligns up to 15 team backlogs and shows dependencies.                                                                                                                                                   |
| **🧪 Analytics Views**   | Create highly sophisticated Power BI reports, based on Azure Boards data (work items). Access default Analytics views or create a custom view.                                                                                                                |

### 📰 1. **Work Items** = Building Blocks

Everything starts with **Work Items**.

- A Work Item = a digital record of something that must be tracked.
- Types depend on the **Process** (Basic, Agile, Scrum, CMMI):

  - **Agile** → Epic, Feature, User Story, Task, Bug
  - **Scrum** → Epic, Feature, Product Backlog Item (PBI), Task, Bug
  - **Basic** → Epic, Issue, Task
  - **CMMI** → Epic, Requirement, Change Request, Task

📌 Each Work Item has:

- **Title/Description** → what needs to be done
- **State** → where it is (To Do, Doing, Done, etc.)
- **Priority** → how important
- **Assigned To** → who owns it
- **Links** → parent/child relationships

👉 Think of Work Items as **cards in your system** — everything else organizes and reports on them.

---

### 📦 **2. Backlogs** – Planning Future Work

- Backlogs = **prioritized lists of work items**, arranged by level:

  - Epic backlog → big initiatives
  - Feature backlog → mid-sized chunks
  - Story/PBI backlog → team-level work

- Purpose = **planning & prioritization**

📌 Example:

- Epic: _Checkout System_
- Feature: _Payment Gateway_
- User Story/PBI: _As a user, I want to pay with credit card_

👉 **Backlog = master product to-do list**.

---

### 📊 **3. Boards** – Visualizing Progress

- Boards = **Kanban view of work items**.
- Columns = states (To Do → Doing → Done).
- Cards = Work Items (Story, Task, Bug, etc.).
- Used for **daily tracking**.

📌 Example:

- Card: “Add to cart” → dragged from Doing → Done.

👉 **Board = visual workflow for the team**.

---

### 🕒 **4. Sprints** – Time-Boxing Work

- Sprint = **time-boxed iteration (2–4 weeks)**.
- Sprint Backlog = subset of backlog items chosen for this sprint.
- Tools inside Sprints:

  - **Capacity Planning** → set availability per member.
  - **Burndown Chart** → tracks progress over sprint.
  - **Task Board** → sprint-focused Kanban.

📌 Example:

- Sprint 1 Goal = “Browsing & Cart features.”
- Items = P1 (Product List), P2 (Product Details), P3 (Add to Cart).

👉 **Sprint = mini project with a deadline.**

---

### 🔍 **5. Queries** – Reporting on Work Items

- Queries = **filters to slice work items**.
- Types: Flat list, Tree, Direct links.
- Queries can be turned into charts or widgets.

📌 Example:

- Query: _All bugs assigned to Ahmed in Sprint 2_.
- Query: _All PBIs tagged as “High Priority.”_

👉 **Query = Excel filter saved in DevOps.**

---

### 📅 **6. Delivery Plans** – Multi-Team Roadmaps

- Delivery Plans = **timeline view of work items** across teams/projects.
- Purpose: Align releases, track dependencies.
- Visual like a **Gantt chart**.

📌 Example:

- Team A → Feature: Product Catalog (Sprint 3)
- Team B → Feature: Payment Gateway (Sprint 4)
- Delivery Plan shows both on timeline.

👉 **Delivery Plan = big-picture roadmap view.**

---

### 📈 **7. Analytics Views** – Custom Data for Reporting

- Analytics Views = curated datasets of Work Items for **custom reporting**.
- Used with **Power BI or Excel**.
- Good for advanced metrics beyond built-in charts.

📌 Example:

- Analytics View: _All completed PBIs last 90 days with Story Points_ → feed into velocity trend report.

👉 **Analytics View = raw data → custom reports.**
