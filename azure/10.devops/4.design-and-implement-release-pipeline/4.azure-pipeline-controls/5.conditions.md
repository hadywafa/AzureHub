# 🎛️ Azure Pipeline Conditions

Conditions allow you to **control when** a **step**, **job**, or **stage** should run. These can be based on:

- Pipeline result (succeeded, failed, canceled)
- Variable values
- Custom expressions
- Dependencies (e.g., only if another job succeeded)

---

## 🧠 SYNTAX OVERVIEW

```yaml
condition: <expression>
```

Expression must evaluate to `true` for the step/job/stage to run.

Built-in functions:

- `succeeded()`
- `failed()`
- `succeededOrFailed()`
- `canceled()`
- `always()`
- `eq()`, `ne()`, `contains()`
- `and()`, `or()`, `not()`

---

## 🧪 Sample Usage

### ✅ 1. Run only if a job succeeded

```yaml
jobs:
  - job: Build
    steps:
      - script: echo "Building..."

  - job: Deploy
    dependsOn: Build
    condition: succeeded() # ✅ Run only if 'Build' succeeded
    steps:
      - script: echo "Deploying..."
```

---

### ❌ 2. Run only if a job failed

```yaml
- job: NotifyFailure
  dependsOn: Build
  condition: failed() # ❌ Run only if Build failed
  steps:
    - script: echo "Build failed! Notifying..."
```

---

### 📑 3. Run even if a previous dependency fails, unless the run is canceled.

This condition ensures the task runs unless the pipeline is canceled — perfect for publishing results even when tests fail, which is critical for debugging and visibility in CI/CD flows

```yaml
- task: PublishTestResults@2
  displayName: "Publish Test Results"
  condition: succeededOrFailed()
  inputs:
    testResultsFiles: "**/test-results.xml"
    failTaskOnFailedTests: true
    publishRunAttachments: true
    testRunTitle: "Automated Tests"
```

---

### 🔁 4. Always run (e.g., cleanup)

```yaml
- job: Cleanup
  condition: always() # 🔁 Run even if previous jobs failed/canceled
  steps:
    - script: echo "Cleaning up temp files"
```

---

### ⚙️ 5. Use custom variable comparison

```yaml
variables:
  deployEnv: prod

- job: Deploy
  condition: eq(variables['deployEnv'], 'prod')  # ✅ Only if deployEnv is 'prod'
  steps:
    - script: echo "Deploying to Production"
```

---

### 🚫 6. Skip based on branch

```yaml
- job: SkipOnMain
  condition: ne(variables['Build.SourceBranch'], 'refs/heads/main')
  steps:
    - script: echo "Running on non-main branch"
```

✅ `ne()` = not equal  
📍 Use `Build.SourceBranch` for full branch path

---

### 🧪 7. Run based on outcome of multiple jobs

```yaml
- job: JobA
  steps:
    - script: echo "Job A"

- job: JobB
  steps:
    - script: echo "Job B"

- job: Deploy
  dependsOn: [JobA, JobB]
  condition: and(succeeded('JobA'), succeeded('JobB')) # ✅ Both must succeed
  steps:
    - script: echo "Deploying after both jobs"
```

---

### ⚖️ 8. Combine AND/OR/NOT logic

```yaml
- job: Conditional
  condition: or(
    and(succeeded(), eq(variables['isPR'], 'true')),
    eq(variables['Build.SourceBranch'], 'refs/heads/dev')
  )
  steps:
    - script: echo "Complex condition matched"
```

---

### 🛑 9. Stop deployment if user disabled it via variable

```yaml
variables:
  deployToProd: false

- job: Deploy
  condition: eq(variables['deployToProd'], 'true')
  steps:
    - script: echo "Deploying to Production"
```

---

### 🤖 10. Check output variable from another job

Job A sets an output:

```yaml
- job: A
  steps:
    - script: echo "##vso[task.setvariable variable=didTestsPass;isOutput=true]true"
```

Job B depends on that value:

```yaml
- job: B
  dependsOn: A
  condition: eq(dependencies.A.outputs['A.didTestsPass'], 'true')
  steps:
    - script: echo "Tests passed, continuing..."
```

---

### 🧹 11. Always run step inside a succeeded job

```yaml
- job: Test
  steps:
    - script: echo "Run tests"

    - script: echo "Collecting logs..."
      condition: always() # 🔁 Even if tests fail
```

---

## ✍🏻 Real Example

### 🧠 What Are We Building?

We're creating a pipeline that follows this flow:

### 🛠️ Build → 🧪 Test → 🚀 Deploy

But there's a twist:

> ❗ **Deployment should only run if the branch is `main`**  
> ❌ If you're working on `dev`, `feature/*`, or any other branch → **skip deployment**

---

### 🤖 How Branch Condition Works

Azure DevOps exposes the **current branch** through a variable called:

```yaml
Build.SourceBranch
```

This variable holds values like:

- `refs/heads/main` → main branch
- `refs/heads/dev` → dev branch
- `refs/heads/feature/login` → feature branch

We compare this against a fixed value (`refs/heads/main`) to check:

```yaml
condition: eq(variables['Build.SourceBranch'], 'refs/heads/main')
```

This means:  
✅ Run this job if the branch is **exactly** `main`  
❌ Otherwise, skip it (job will show as “Skipped”)

---

### 🧠 Summary Logic Flow

```text
IF any branch is pushed:
    → Build runs
    → Test runs (after build)

    → Deploy runs ONLY IF:
        - Current branch == 'refs/heads/main'
        - Build & Test succeeded
```

  - "*"

  vmImage: "ubuntu-latest"
