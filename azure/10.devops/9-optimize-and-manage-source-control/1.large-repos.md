# 🚫 Challenges with Large Repositories (Especially with Binary Files)

> “Git was built for **text**, not **terabytes**.”  
> As your repo grows, especially with binary content, things get… ugly. 😩

## 🧠 So What Is a "Large Repository"?

A **large repository** typically refers to:

- 🧠 Lots of commits & branches (long history)
- 🏗️ Massive files (media, builds, ISOs, etc.)
- 📁 Thousands of files & directories
- 📦 Binary files (PDF, .zip, .exe, .dll, .psd...)

💥 These push Git beyond its sweet spot.

---

## 📉 Challenge #1: Performance Degrades Over Time

Git has to:

- Load **entire repo metadata** into memory
- Scan **all diffs across history**
- Compress/diff even binary blobs (which it sucks at)

💣 Result: Commands like `git status`, `git checkout`, `git log`, `git blame` become **slow** and **painful**.

---

## 📦 Challenge #2: Binary Files Are Git’s Kryptonite

### ❌ Problem with binaries:

- You can’t **diff** or **merge** them
- Git stores a **full copy** of every version — not just the delta (unlike text)

> A 10 MB `.psd` edited 20 times = 200 MB repo weight 💥

### 🔥 Why It’s a Problem:

| Git Behavior      | Works well with text? | Works with binaries?  |
| ----------------- | --------------------- | --------------------- |
| Diff/merge        | ✅ Yes                | ❌ No (just conflict) |
| Delta compression | ✅ Yes                | ❌ No                 |
| Version tracking  | ✅ Great              | ❌ Expensive          |

## 📁 Challenge #3: Repo Size Affects Everyone

- **Cloning** the repo? Takes forever 🐢
- **CI/CD build times**? Slower due to downloading huge repos
- **Switching branches**? Laggy if you swap between big versions
- **Contributors**? Less willing to work with a bloated monster repo

---

## 🔄 Challenge #4: Versioning Build Artifacts? Big No-No 🚫

If you're storing:

- `.zip` / `.jar` / `.exe`
- `.dll`, `.deb`, `.msi`
- Compiled outputs or NuGet/NPM packages

…you’re likely **using Git like a file server**, not a version control system.

🧼 Instead:

- Use **Azure Artifacts**, **JFrog**, **S3**, or **Azure Blob** to store binaries
- Keep Git clean for source code + config

---

## 🧮 Challenge #5: Git Storage Bloats Over Time

Git saves:

- Objects (blobs, trees, commits) in `.git/objects`
- Each binary = unique blob (no delta compression)

Even if the file is renamed, it’s duplicated in Git storage.

```bash
du -sh .git/
```

👀 You'll be shocked how big that folder is in large repos.

---

## 💀 Real Example

A company accidentally committed:

- 2GB `.zip` file (compiled build)
- Deleted it later

But guess what? Git history keeps it **forever** unless you do **manual purge**:

```bash
git filter-repo --path your/huge/file.zip --invert-paths
```

😱 Regular users still clone that 2GB unless you rewrite history.

## 🧰 Fixes / Best Practices

### ✅ Do This:

| Fix                              | Benefit                           |
| -------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Use `.gitignore` wisely          | Avoid committing builds & outputs |
| Use Git LFS (Large File Storage) | Offloads binary storage to cloud  |
| Archive artifacts externally     | Keep Git for **code only**        |
| Modularize repos                 | Break monoliths into submodules   |
| Cleanup old history              | Run `git gc` / `filter-repo`      |

---

## 🧪 Bonus: Use Git LFS for Binary Files

**Git LFS** = “Large File Storage”

```bash
git lfs install
git lfs track "*.psd"
git add .gitattributes
git add your.psd
git commit -m "Track with LFS"
```

🔐 Git LFS replaces binary blobs with **pointers**
📦 Actual files stored outside repo (Azure DevOps, GitHub, S3...)

✅ Ideal for:

- Designers (images, audio, video)
- Game developers
- Machine learning models

## ✅ Summary: Binary Files + Git = Handle With Care

| Problem                      | Fix                             |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Large repo slows down Git    | Split repo, clean history       |
| Binary files bloat size      | Use Git LFS or external storage |
| Diff/merge doesn’t work      | Track binary changes with tools |
| Old artifacts remain forever | Use `git filter-repo` to purge  |
| CI/CD cloning is slow        | Shallow clone, artifact caching |
