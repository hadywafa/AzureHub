# 🧹 Azure Pipelines Retention Policies

Retention policies determine **how long** Azure DevOps keeps:

- Pipeline **runs**
- Build **artifacts**
- Test **results**
- Logs
- Symbols
- Intermediate files

Once the retention period is over, Azure DevOps **automatically deletes** the data to save space.

---

## 📦 Types of Retention

Azure DevOps applies retention at **3 levels**:

| Level              | Applies To            | Scope                             |
| ------------------ | --------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| **Project-level**  | All pipelines         | Default policy across the project |
| **Pipeline-level** | Individual pipelines  | Overrides project setting         |
| **Run-level**      | Specific pipeline run | Pin/unpin to keep forever         |

---

## 🧠 Why Is Retention Important?

Without proper retention:

- Artifacts/logs consume **GBs** over time
- You risk hitting **storage quotas**
- CI/CD becomes **slower and more expensive**

---

## 🔧 1. Project-Level Retention Policy

> 📍 Location: **Project Settings → Pipelines → Settings**

### 🔹 What You Can Control:

- **Days to retain runs** (default: 30 days)
- **Minimum runs to retain per pipeline**
- **Retention for pull request builds**
- Delete **artifacts**, **logs**, **test results**
- Retain X **most recent runs** regardless of age
- Delete even **if the run failed or partially succeeded**

</div>

---

## 🛠️ 2. Pipeline-Level Retention Policy (UI)

> 📍 Edit Pipeline → ⚙️ Settings → Retention

### 🔹 What You Can Override:

- **Number of days** to retain
- **Number of runs** to keep
- Apply to **branch filters**
- Choose whether to delete:

  - Artifacts
  - Logs
  - Test results

This allows different retention per **environment** or **pipeline**.

---

## 🧾 3. Run-Level Retention (Pinning)

> 📍 Pipeline Run → ... → **Retain run**

### 🔹 Pinning a Run:

- Prevents deletion by any retention policy
- Useful for:

  - **Stable releases**
  - **Auditing requirements**
  - **Historic deployments**

You can unpin at any time.

```yaml
# YAML - Pin a pipeline run
retention:
  days: 60
  minimumToKeep: 3
  artifacts: true
  logs: true
```

---

## 🧰 4. YAML Retention Block (Per-Run)

```yaml
jobs:
  - job: build
    pool:
      vmImage: "ubuntu-latest"
    steps:
      - script: echo "Build stuff"

    retention:
      days: 10 # Override default retention for this run
      minimumToKeep: 1 # Keep at least 1
      artifacts: true # Clean up artifacts
      logs: true # Clean up logs
```

> 🎯 This helps if you want to **reduce retention** for nightly builds or **increase** it for important ones.

---

## 📤 5. Release Pipeline Retention

> 📍 Pipelines → Releases → ⚙️ → Retention

- Retention is defined **per release definition**
- You can control:

  - **Retention for releases**
  - **Retain releases based on environment success**
  - **Retain X number of latest releases**
  - Delete older releases and their artifacts

---

## 🚦 6. Artifact Retention with Feeds

If you publish artifacts to an **Azure Artifacts feed**, retention is managed **independently** by the feed’s settings.

- Go to **Artifacts → Feed → Settings → Retention**
- Configure cleanup rules for **packages and versions**

## ⛳ Special Behavior and Gotchas

| Feature                   | Behavior                                           |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| **Manually deleted run**  | Overrides pinning                                  |
| **Retained run**          | Ignored by global policy                           |
| **Parallel jobs**         | Not affected by retention                          |
| **Long-running PRs**      | May get cleaned up early if not retained           |
| **YAML + UI conflicts**   | YAML setting takes priority for that run           |
| **Multi-stage pipelines** | Each stage’s output is retained or purged together |

---

## 🔍 How to Monitor Retention Impact

1. Go to **Pipelines → Builds**
2. Use the filter: `Retained = false` to see what will be cleaned
3. Use `az devops` CLI to list retention policies and pinned runs

```bash
az pipelines runs list --project MyProject
```

---

## 💡 Best Practices

✅ Retain only **essential releases**
✅ Set short retention for **nightly builds**
✅ Use **minimumToKeep** to avoid losing last N builds
✅ Enable deletion of **test results** to reduce clutter
✅ Pin **prod/stable** builds manually or with tags
✅ Review retention usage every **2-3 months**
