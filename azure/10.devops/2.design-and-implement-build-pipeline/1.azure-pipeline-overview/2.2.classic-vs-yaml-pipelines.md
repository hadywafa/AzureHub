# ✍️ Azure DevOps Pipeline Editors — Classic vs YAML

> Azure Pipelines support two primary editors:
>
> - ✅ **Classic Editor** (UI-based, visual, legacy)
> - ✅ **YAML Editor** (code-based, modern)

Let’s break them down like a DevOps engineer would 👷‍♂️.

## 🧮 1. YAML Pipeline Editor

> 💡 **Modern DevOps standard** — fully version-controlled, code-based, scalable

### ✅ Features

| Feature                | Description                                                  |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 📝 Git-based           | Pipeline logic is saved in your repo (`azure-pipelines.yml`) |
| 🧠 Pipeline-as-code    | Enables code reviews, approvals, traceability                |
| 🔄 Combined CI/CD      | Supports **multi-stage** build + deploy workflows            |
| ♻️ Reusable logic      | Supports templates, variables, runtime conditions            |
| 🔐 Uses `Environments` | Track deployments & approvals in environments (Dev/QA/Prod)  |

### 🛠️ Real YAML Example

```yaml
trigger:
  branches:
    include: [main]

pool:
  vmImage: "ubuntu-latest"

stages:
  - stage: Build
    jobs:
      - job: BuildApp
        steps:
          - task: DotNetCoreCLI@2
            inputs:
              command: "build"
              projects: "**/*.csproj"
  - stage: Deploy
    jobs:
      - deployment: DeployToWeb
        environment: "Dev"
        strategy:
          runOnce:
            deploy:
              steps:
                - script: echo Deploying to Dev!
```

✅ `environment: 'Dev'` refers to the **Azure DevOps Environment**, where you can configure approvals and monitor releases.

## 🎨 2. Classic Editor

> 💡 GUI-first, legacy-friendly option with full UI control
> Ideal for small teams or non-coders.

### ✅ Features

| Feature                   | Description                                               |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| 🖱️ Visual Designer        | Add tasks, phases, triggers using the Azure DevOps UI     |
| 🧱 Separate Pipelines     | Requires separate pipelines for Build and Release         |
| ✅ Manual Approvals       | Native UI support for pre/post-deployment approvals       |
| ❌ No Git versioning      | Pipeline logic stored in DevOps, not source-controlled    |
| 🚧 Uses Deployment Groups | Deploy to physical VMs, on-prem targets, or custom agents |

## 🧠 Environments vs Deployment Groups

| Feature               | YAML Pipeline (Modern) | Classic Pipeline (Legacy) |
| --------------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------- |
| **Deployment Target** | `environment` block    | `Deployment Groups`       |
| **Approval Logic**    | Via environment UI     | Native pre/post approvals |
| **Scope**             | Logical Dev/Test/Prod  | VM/Agent group targeting  |
| **Security**          | Fine-grained + RBAC    | Agent-based               |
