# **`PublishPipelineArtifact@1`** Task

📖 The `PublishPipelineArtifact@1` task **uploads files from the agent** (usually build output) to **Azure DevOps artifact storage**, so they can be:

- Used in **later jobs or stages**
- Downloaded manually or in deployment pipelines
- Retained with the pipeline run

🧠 Think of it as:

> “Take this folder or file and store it in Azure Pipelines cloud storage under a name.”

## 🧱 Full Parameters of `PublishPipelineArtifact@1`

```yaml
- task: PublishPipelineArtifact@1
  inputs:
    targetPath: "<path/to/your/files>"
    artifact: "<artifact-name>"
    publishLocation: "pipeline" # optional
```

Let’s explain all the parameters:

| Input             | Required | Description                                                                                        |
| ----------------- | -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `targetPath`      | ✅ Yes   | The **path to a file or directory** on the agent to publish. Can be absolute or relative.          |
| `artifact`        | ✅ Yes   | The **name of the artifact** you want to assign. This is what downstream jobs will refer to.       |
| `publishLocation` | ❌ No    | Should be `'pipeline'`. It’s the only valid value for this task. Present for legacy compatibility. |

---

## ✅ Real Example

```yaml
- script: |
    mkdir output
    echo "Hello World" > output/hello.txt

- task: PublishPipelineArtifact@1
  inputs:
    targetPath: "output"
    artifact: "hello-artifact"
```

This publishes the `output` folder and all its contents to Azure DevOps storage under the name `hello-artifact`.

---

## 📦 Where does the artifact go?

It gets uploaded to Azure DevOps blob storage and is associated with the **pipeline run** (not the agent).

You can download it later with:

```yaml
- task: DownloadPipelineArtifact@2
  inputs:
    artifact: "hello-artifact"
```

---

## ❓ Why not always use `$(Build.ArtifactStagingDirectory)`?

Typically resolves to something like **C:\agent_work\1\a**  
You **can**, and it’s **common** in classic pipelines or build templates:

```yaml
- task: CopyFiles@2
  inputs:
    sourceFolder: "$(Build.SourcesDirectory)"
    contents: "**/*.zip"
    targetFolder: "$(Build.ArtifactStagingDirectory)"

- task: PublishPipelineArtifact@1
  inputs:
    targetPath: "$(Build.ArtifactStagingDirectory)"
    artifact: "drop"
```

But in modern YAML pipelines, using **custom folders** like `output/` or even single files (`targetPath: 'build.log'`) is often **cleaner and easier**, especially when:

- You are not using legacy `Build.ArtifactStagingDirectory`-based tasks
- You want to avoid unnecessary copying and just publish what you need

So this is **purely a choice**, not a rule.

### TL;DR:

| Option                                          | Use Case                                                                 |
| ----------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `targetPath: $(Build.ArtifactStagingDirectory)` | When you're staging multiple files in one place, often in complex builds |
| `targetPath: 'output/'` or `'myfile.txt'`       | Simpler builds, modern YAML, or single-artifact outputs                  |

## 🤔 What's the difference from `PublishBuildArtifacts@1`?

| Feature                       | `PublishPipelineArtifact@1` ✅ | `PublishBuildArtifacts@1` ❌ |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------ | ---------------------------- |
| YAML-native                   | ✅ Yes                         | ❌ Not designed for YAML     |
| Artifact download speed       | ⚡ Faster (streamed)           | 🐢 Slower                    |
| Good for large artifacts      | ✅ Yes                         | ❌ No                        |
| Download from other pipelines | ✅ Yes (via pipeline resource) | ✅ Yes                       |
| Used in multi-stage pipelines | ✅ Preferred                   | ❌ Legacy / deprecated use   |

> ✅ **Use `PublishPipelineArtifact@1` in YAML pipelines**  
> ❌ Only use `PublishBuildArtifacts@1` if you're still on classic builds

## 🧠 Pro Tip: Multiple Artifacts?

You can publish as many artifacts as you like — just give them **unique names**:

```yaml
- task: PublishPipelineArtifact@1
  inputs:
    targetPath: "logs"
    artifact: "logs"

- task: PublishPipelineArtifact@1
  inputs:
    targetPath: "bin/release"
    artifact: "binaries"
```
