# üîΩ **`DownloadPipelineArtifact@2`** Task

> The modern way to download artifacts in Azure Pipelines.

---

## üì¶ What is `DownloadPipelineArtifact@2`?

The `DownloadPipelineArtifact` task **downloads previously published artifacts** from:

- The same pipeline run (most common)
- Another pipeline run (if configured via `resources:` block)

These artifacts must have been uploaded using `PublishPipelineArtifact@1`.

---

## üîÅ Typical Use Case

You have a multi-stage pipeline:

```yaml
- stage: Build
  jobs:
    - job: BuildJob
      steps:
        - task: PublishPipelineArtifact@1
          inputs:
            targetPath: "dist"
            artifact: "build-output"

- stage: Deploy
  dependsOn: Build
  jobs:
    - job: DeployJob
      steps:
        - task: DownloadPipelineArtifact@2
          inputs:
            artifact: "build-output"
        - script: ls $(Pipeline.Workspace)/build-output
```

## ‚úÖ Simple Example (same pipeline)

```yaml
- task: DownloadPipelineArtifact@2
  inputs:
    artifact: "build-output"
```

This downloads the artifact named `build-output` and places it into:

```bash
$(Pipeline.Workspace)/build-output/
```

---

## üß™ Downloading All Artifacts (Wildcard)

Want all artifacts from all parallel jobs/stages?

```yaml
- task: DownloadPipelineArtifact@2
  inputs:
    patterns: "**" # or '*.zip'
```

This grabs **every artifact** from the current run and places them in:

```bash
$(Pipeline.Workspace)/<artifact-name>/
```

Each artifact ends up in its own folder.

---

## üîÑ Download from Another Pipeline

If you want to download artifacts from another pipeline, you need to configure `resources:` first.

```yaml
resources:
  pipelines:
    - pipeline: upstream
      source: "BuildPipeline"
      trigger: true

steps:
  - download: upstream
    artifact: build-output
```

Or to download **everything**:

```yaml
- download: upstream
```

Internally uses the same blob-backed storage from the published pipeline artifacts.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works Internally

### When this task runs:

1. It looks up the current pipeline run‚Äôs artifact metadata via Azure DevOps REST API.
2. Validates the artifact name (or matches patterns).
3. Fetches the file(s) from Azure DevOps-managed **artifact blob storage**.
4. Extracts and places them in the correct folder inside the agent (usually `$(Pipeline.Workspace)`).
5. Each artifact is extracted into its **own folder** unless `path` is overridden.

üß† Each agent has an **isolated workspace**, so if you want to reuse artifacts between agents, downloading is required.

---

## üßæ Real Output Example

Say you publish:

```yaml
- task: PublishPipelineArtifact@1
  inputs:
    targetPath: "dist"
    artifact: "frontend"
```

Then later:

```yaml
- task: DownloadPipelineArtifact@2
  inputs:
    artifact: "frontend"
```

This will place files at:

```ini
$(Pipeline.Workspace)/frontend/dist/index.html
```

Unless you override `path` to something else.

| ------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Single artifact from previous stage   | Use `artifact: 'name'`                                                |
| Multiple artifacts from parallel jobs | Use `patterns: '**'`                                                  |
| Want to control folder path?          | Use `path: 'custom/path'`                                             |
| Sharing between pipelines             | Use `resources.pipelines` and `download: pipeline`                    |
| Want logs/debug?                      | Add `system.debug: true` in variables to see underlying HTTP requests |
