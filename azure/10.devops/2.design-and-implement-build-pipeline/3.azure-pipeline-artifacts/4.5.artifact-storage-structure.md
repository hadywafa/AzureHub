# ☁️ How Artifacts Are Stored in Azure DevOps Blob Storage (Internally)

When you publish an artifact using:

```yaml
- task: PublishPipelineArtifact@1
  inputs:
    targetPath: "output"
    artifact: "frontend-build"
```

👉 Here's what happens:

1. Azure DevOps **compresses** the contents of the `targetPath` (e.g., `output/`)
2. It creates a **ZIP-like blob package** and stores it in Azure DevOps' **internal Azure Blob Storage**
3. This is done behind the scenes, at an internal storage path like:

```link
https://dev.azure.com/{org}/{project}/_apis/pipelines/{pipelineId}/runs/{runId}/artifacts?artifactName=frontend-build
```

🧠 **You don’t have access to the actual Azure Storage Account** — it’s fully managed by Azure DevOps.

## 📦 Artifact Layout in Azure Blob Storage

Internally, artifacts are stored **exactly as the directory structure in your `targetPath`** when you published them.

So for example:

- If `output/` contains:

  ```ini
  output/
  ├── index.html
  └── css/
      └── styles.css
  ```

- And you run:

  ```yaml
  targetPath: "output"
  artifact: "frontend-build"
  ```

Then Azure stores it **as a ZIP-like package** under `frontend-build/` in blob storage:

```ini
frontend-build/
├── index.html
└── css/
    └── styles.css
```

👉 There's **no wrapping** of the folder name unless `output` was inside another folder. It simply uploads the **contents of the `targetPath`**, not the folder itself.

## 🔽 Now, When You **Download** It:

Let’s say you run:

```yaml
- task: DownloadPipelineArtifact@2
  inputs:
    artifact: "frontend-build"
```

Then Azure DevOps will:

- Locate the blob storage ZIP for `frontend-build`
- Download and extract it into:

```bash
$(Pipeline.Workspace)/frontend-build/
```

📂 Final structure on the agent will be:

```ini
$(Pipeline.Workspace)/
└── frontend-build/
    ├── index.html
    └── css/
        └── styles.css
```

---

## ✅ Optional: Override `targetPath` on Download

If you specify:

```yaml
- task: DownloadPipelineArtifact@2
  inputs:
    artifact: "frontend-build"
    targetPath: "my-custom-folder"
```

It will extract into:

```ini
my-custom-folder/
├── index.html
└── css/
    └── styles.css
```

So the **local download path is controlled by `targetPath` on download**, and the structure inside it matches what was inside `targetPath` on publish.

## ⚠️ Common Misunderstanding

### ❌ This is **not** the structure:

```ini
$(Pipeline.Workspace)/<artifact>/<target-path>/...
```

### ✅ This **is** the actual structure:

```ini
$(Pipeline.Workspace)/<artifact>/<contents-of-targetPath>
```

> It does **not nest the `targetPath` folder itself**. It flattens it into the artifact root.

---

## 📌 Final Visual Breakdown

### 🧼 On agent (before publish):

```ini
output/
├── index.html
└── css/
    └── styles.css
```

### 📦 Artifact in Azure DevOps (blob-backed):

```ini
artifact name: frontend-build
structure:
├── index.html
└── css/styles.css
```

### 📥 After download (default):

```ini
$(Pipeline.Workspace)/frontend-build/
├── index.html
└── css/styles.css
```

### 📥 After download (custom targetPath):

```ini
myfolder/
├── index.html
└── css/styles.css
```

| -------------------------- | ------------ | ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `PublishPipelineArtifact`  | `targetPath` | What to upload            | Your local folder (e.g., `output/`)                   |
| `PublishPipelineArtifact`  | `artifact`   | Name in blob storage      | e.g., `frontend-build`                                |
