# 🧪 Microsoft Test & Feedback Extension

## 🔹 1. What is it?

- A **browser extension** (for Chrome/Edge).
- Lets testers, product owners, or even business users **report bugs, create test cases, capture feedback** **without leaving the app they’re testing**.
- Integrates directly with **Azure DevOps** (Boards, Test Plans, Work Items).

👉 Think of it as: **“Lightweight testing + feedback tool right inside your browser.”**

## 🔹 2. Why Use It?

- 🚀 Speed up bug reporting (capture screenshots, notes, and system info in one click).
- 🎯 Great for **exploratory testing**.
- 🔄 Connects to Azure DevOps → feedback goes straight into your backlog (as Bugs, Tasks, or Test Cases).
- 👩‍💻 Works for both **signed-in testers** (connected to Azure DevOps project) and **stakeholders** (can submit feedback without license).

---

## 🔹 3. Modes of Use

The extension works in **two modes**:

1. **Connected Mode**

   - Signed in to Azure DevOps project.
   - Bugs & test cases go directly into your project Boards/Backlog.
   - Example: QA team testing Sprint 5 features in staging.

2. **Standalone Mode**

   - Not connected to Azure DevOps.
   - Captures screenshots, notes, recording.
   - Useful when customer/stakeholder just wants to give feedback, later export to DevOps.
