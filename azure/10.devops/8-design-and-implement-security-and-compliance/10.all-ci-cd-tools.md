# 🛠️ Common Tools in DevOps CI/CD (Enterprise-Grade)

## ⚙️ 1. CI/CD Orchestration (Pipeline Engines)

These are the **backbone tools** that run your builds, tests, and deployments.

- **Azure DevOps Pipelines** → Microsoft ecosystem (common in finance, government, healthcare).
- **Jenkins** → open-source, highly customizable, plugin-heavy (banks, telecom).
- **GitHub Actions** → modern, cloud-native CI/CD with strong DevSecOps adoption.
- **GitLab CI/CD** → self-hosted + cloud, popular for integrated SCM + CI/CD.
- **CircleCI** → SaaS CI/CD, used by startups and mid-size enterprises.
- **Bamboo (Atlassian)** → legacy enterprise users (often paired with Jira).
- **TeamCity (JetBrains)** → less common but strong in dev-centric shops.

👉 **Exam note:** Azure DevOps Pipelines = most tested in AZ-400.

## 👨‍💻 2. Code Quality & Security

Scanners that ensure your code is **clean, secure, compliant** before release.

- **SonarQube / SonarCloud** → Static Application Security Testing (SAST) + code quality.
- **Checkmarx** → advanced SAST used in banks and secure industries.
- **Fortify (Micro Focus)** → heavyweight SAST for regulated enterprises.
- **Veracode** → SaaS SAST/DAST platform.
- **Snyk** → open-source dependency & container security.
- **Black Duck (Synopsys)** → Software Composition Analysis (SCA) for OSS risks.
- **WhiteSource (Mend)** → alternative to Black Duck for OSS management.
- **Dependabot (GitHub)** → automated dependency security updates.

---

## 📦 3. Artifact & Package Management

Tools to **store and distribute build outputs** (binaries, Docker images, libs).

- **Azure Artifacts** → feeds for NuGet, npm, Maven, Python, Universal.
- **JFrog Artifactory** → enterprise-grade artifact repository (universal).
- **Nexus Repository (Sonatype)** → popular for Maven, Java shops.
- **Harbor** → open-source container registry.
- **Docker Hub / ACR (Azure Container Registry) / ECR (AWS) / GCR (Google)** → container image registries.

---

## ☁️ 4. Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

Provision infra **automatically via pipelines**.

- **Terraform** → the de-facto IaC for multi-cloud.
- **Pulumi** → IaC with general-purpose languages (JS, Python, C#).
- **Bicep (Azure)** → Azure-native IaC.
- **CloudFormation (AWS)** → AWS-native IaC.
- **Ansible** → config management & infra provisioning.
- **Chef / Puppet** → older config management still in enterprises.

---

## 🧪 5. Testing & Quality Gates

Automated testing frameworks integrated in pipelines.

- **JUnit / NUnit / PyTest / Mocha** → unit testing frameworks.
- **Selenium / Cypress / Playwright** → UI & browser testing.
- **Postman / Newman** → API testing in pipelines.
- **JMeter / k6** → load and performance testing.
- **OWASP ZAP** → DAST (Dynamic App Security Testing).

---

## 🔒 6. Security & Compliance (DevSecOps)

- **Aqua Security / Prisma Cloud** → container & cloud runtime security.
- **Trivy** → open-source container image + IaC vulnerability scanner.
- **Anchore** → container policy enforcement.
- **Twistlock (Palo Alto)** → container + cloud-native app security.

---

## 📊 7. Monitoring & Observability (Post-Deployment in CD)

- **Prometheus + Grafana** → metrics & visualization.
- **ELK / OpenSearch (Elastic, Logstash, Kibana)** → logging & analytics.
- **Splunk** → enterprise log + SIEM.
- **Datadog** → SaaS monitoring (logs, metrics, APM).
- **New Relic / AppDynamics / Dynatrace** → Application Performance Monitoring (APM).
- **Azure Monitor + Application Insights** → Microsoft-native observability.

---

## 📬 8. Communication & Collaboration

- **Microsoft Teams** → notifications, bots (deep Azure DevOps integration).
- **Slack** → DevOps alerts + slash commands.
- **Email alerts** → still common for compliance/exec reporting.
- **Service Hooks / Webhooks** → integrate with external services (Trello, Jenkins, Jira, PagerDuty).

---

## 🧾 9. Governance & Compliance

- **Sonatype Nexus Lifecycle** → enforce open-source usage rules.
- **OPA (Open Policy Agent)** → policy enforcement in pipelines.
- **HashiCorp Sentinel** → governance in Terraform Enterprise.
- **Azure Policy + Defender for Cloud** → compliance in Azure.
