Great question — this **Azure Load Balancer created automatically with AKS** confuses *a lot* of people, even seniors.
Let’s break it down **cleanly, practically, and without hand-waving**.

---

## 1️⃣ What is the Load Balancer created with AKS?

When you create an AKS cluster from the Azure Portal, Azure **automatically creates an Azure Load Balancer (ALB)** in the **node resource group**.

> This Load Balancer is **not for your application by default**
> It is **infrastructure-level networking** for AKS.

---

## 2️⃣ Type of Load Balancer

AKS always creates:

### ✅ **Standard Azure Load Balancer**

(not Basic)

Why?

* Required for production
* Supports:

  * High availability
  * Availability Zones
  * Better SNAT scaling
  * Secure by default (no open inbound)

---

## 3️⃣ Why AKS needs a Load Balancer (core reasons)

The default AKS Load Balancer is used for **3 main purposes** 👇

---

## 4️⃣ Use Case #1: Outbound Internet Access (VERY IMPORTANT)

### This is the BIG one 🔥

If you **don’t attach a NAT Gateway**, AKS uses this Load Balancer for:

➡ **SNAT (Source Network Address Translation)**

### Flow

```text
Pod → Node → Azure Load Balancer → Internet
```

* Pod IP (overlay or CNI)
* ⬇ SNAT
* Source IP becomes **Load Balancer public IP**

### What the internet sees

```text
Source IP = AKS Load Balancer Public IP
```

🔑 **This LB is the default outbound path**

---

## 5️⃣ Default outbound configuration

By default, AKS creates:

| Setting       | Default        |
| ------------- | -------------- |
| Outbound type | `loadBalancer` |
| Public IP     | 1 Public IP    |
| SNAT ports    | Azure-managed  |
| Idle timeout  | 4 minutes      |
| Health probes | Node-based     |

You can see this in:

```
AKS → Networking → Outbound type
```

---

## 6️⃣ Use Case #2: Service type LoadBalancer (your apps)

When **YOU** create this in Kubernetes:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: my-api
spec:
  type: LoadBalancer
```

AKS will:

✔ Reuse the **same Azure Load Balancer**
✔ Add:

* Frontend IP config
* Backend pool
* Health probe
* Load balancing rule

💡 It does **not** create a new LB every time (unless configured).

---

## 7️⃣ Use Case #3: Node-level health & control-plane traffic

The LB is also used for:

* Node health probes
* Control-plane ↔ node communication
* Internal cluster operations

This is why **you should never delete it manually** 🚨

---

## 8️⃣ Where is this Load Balancer created?

📍 **Node Resource Group**

```
MC_<aks-name>_<region>_<random>
```

Inside it, you’ll find:

* Azure Load Balancer
* Public IP
* NICs
* VMSS
* Route tables

⚠ **AKS manages this RG — don’t modify resources directly**

---

## 9️⃣ Default inbound configuration (important!)

By default:

❌ **NO inbound rules**
❌ **NO open ports**
❌ **NO public exposure**

Why?

* Standard LB is **secure by default**
* Nothing is exposed unless Kubernetes asks for it

Only when you create:

* `Service: LoadBalancer`
* Ingress controller with LB

➡ Azure adds inbound rules

---

## 🔟 What if I use Azure CNI Overlay?

Still the same LB behavior 👇

| Feature        | Works the same? |
| -------------- | --------------- |
| Outbound SNAT  | ✅ Yes           |
| Pod IP exposed | ❌ No            |
| Source IP      | Node IP / LB IP |
| Ingress        | Node-based      |

Overlay **does not remove** the need for the LB.

---

## 1️⃣1️⃣ NAT Gateway vs Load Balancer (important comparison)

| Feature          | Load Balancer | NAT Gateway |
| ---------------- | ------------- | ----------- |
| Default in AKS   | ✅ Yes         | ❌ No        |
| SNAT scalability | ⚠ Limited     | ✅ Very high |
| Predictable IP   | ⚠ Sometimes   | ✅ Yes       |
| Recommended prod | ❌             | ✅           |
| Cost             | Included      | Extra       |

👉 **Best practice**:

> For production AKS → **Attach NAT Gateway**

---

## 1️⃣2️⃣ Can I disable this Load Balancer?

❌ No
AKS **requires** it unless:

* You switch outbound type to `userAssignedNATGateway`

Even then:

* LB may still exist for inbound services

---

## 1️⃣3️⃣ One-line mental model (very important 🧠)

> **The default AKS Load Balancer is primarily an outbound SNAT device and a shared infrastructure LB for Kubernetes services — not an application LB by default.**

---

## 1️⃣4️⃣ Exam + Interview gold answers 💎

**Q: Why does AKS create a Load Balancer?**
✔ For outbound internet access (SNAT)
✔ For Service type LoadBalancer
✔ For node and control-plane health

**Q: Is it safe to delete it?**
❌ No — AKS will break

**Q: Should I use it in production?**
⚠ For small clusters yes
✅ For large clusters → NAT Gateway

* Explain **exact SNAT port limits & exhaustion**
* Draw **LB vs NAT Gateway traffic side-by-side**
* Explain **Ingress Controller vs Load Balancer vs App Gateway**
