# 🎩 Azure Identity Role

Azure doesn't have a "role identity" in the same sense AWS does. Let's break it down clearly:

## 🆚 Azure vs AWS: Role Identity Concept

| Feature                     | **AWS IAM Role**                                                                     | **Azure Equivalent**                                                                          |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Role as an identity**     | ✅ Yes — roles are identities that can be assumed by users, services, or other roles | ❌ No — roles are _not_ identities; they are permission containers                            |
| **Attachable to resources** | ✅ Yes — roles can be assumed by EC2, Lambda, etc.                                   | ✅ Yes — permissions are assigned via **Azure RBAC** to identities                            |
| **Temporary credentials**   | ✅ Yes — roles issue temporary credentials when assumed                              | ❌ No — Azure uses persistent identity bindings (e.g., service principal or managed identity) |

## 🔐 What Azure Has Instead

Azure uses **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**, where:

- **Roles** are **permission sets** (e.g., Reader, Contributor, Owner)
- **Identities** (users, groups, service principals, managed identities) are **assigned roles** on resources

So in Azure:

> 🔸 **Roles are not identities** — they are _assigned to_ identities.

## 🧠 Example

If you want a Function App to access a Storage Account:

- **In AWS**: You create an IAM Role with S3 permissions and attach it to the Lambda.
- **In Azure**: You use a **managed identity** for the Function App and assign it the **Storage Blob Data Contributor** role on the Storage Account.

## ✅ Summary

You're correct:

> Azure has **no role identity** like AWS IAM roles.  
> Instead, Azure uses **RBAC roles assigned to identities** (users, groups, SPs, managed identities).
