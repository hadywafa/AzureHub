# 🌟 **Azure Virtual Machine Availability (HA)**

**High Availability (HA)** ensures that your applications and services remain **accessible** and **operational** even during hardware failures, maintenance, or unexpected disruptions. In Azure, achieving HA for **Virtual Machines (VMs)** involves strategically distributing your VMs across different fault domains, update domains, and physical locations. This minimizes downtime and ensures continuous service delivery.

**Why HA Matters:**

- **Business Continuity:** Keeps your services online, maintaining user trust.
- **Performance Reliability:** Ensures smooth application performance without interruptions.
- **Cost Efficiency:** Reduces financial losses associated with downtime and outages.

## ✨ **Key Features for Enhancing VM Availability**

Azure provides several robust features to maximize the availability of your VMs. Here's a breakdown of each:

### 🏢 **1. Availability Sets**

**Purpose:**  
Group multiple VMs within a single Azure data center to protect against hardware and software failures.

**Components:**

- **Fault Domains (FD):**

  - **Definition:** Physical units within a data center, such as racks, that share a common power source and network switch.
  - **Benefit:** Spreads VMs across different hardware to prevent all from being affected by a single hardware failure.

- **Update Domains (UD):**
  - **Definition:** Logical units that Azure uses to sequence updates and maintenance.
  - **Benefit:** Ensures that not all VMs are rebooted simultaneously during planned maintenance, maintaining application availability.

**Benefits:**

- **99.95% Availability:** Guarantees high availability by distributing VMs across multiple fault and update domains.

**How to Use:**

1. **Create an Availability Set** when deploying your VMs.
2. **Deploy VMs** within this set to automatically distribute them across fault and update domains.

**Example1:**

<div align="center">
  <img src="images/vm-availability-set-2.png" alt="Fault and Update Domains" style="width: 80%; border-radius: 10px; border: 2px solid white;">
</div>

---

**Example2:**

| VM  | Fault Domain | Update Domain |
| --- | ------------ | ------------- |
| VM1 | FD1          | UD1           |
| VM2 | FD2          | UD1           |
| VM3 | FD3          | UD1           |
| VM4 | FD1          | UD2           |
| VM5 | FD2          | UD2           |
| VM6 | FD3          | UD2           |

**How They Work Together:**

- **Fault Domain Failure:** If FD1 fails, only VM1 and VM4 are impacted; other VMs remain operational.
- **Update Domain Maintenance:** During maintenance, Azure updates UD1 first (VM1, VM2, VM3), then UD2 (VM4, VM5, VM6), ensuring some VMs are always running.

**Use Case:**  
Ideal for multi-tier applications where different roles (e.g., web servers, database servers) need to remain available during maintenance or unexpected outages.
