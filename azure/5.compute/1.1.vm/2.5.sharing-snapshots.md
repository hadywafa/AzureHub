# 🔄 Sharing Azure Disk Snapshots — The Right Way

> Azure lets you create snapshots of your VM OS/Data disks, but sharing them **depends on how the snapshot is encrypted**. And here's the **key distinction** 👇

---

## 🔐 Snapshot Encryption & Sharing 🔍

Azure supports **2 types of encryption** for VM snapshots:

| Type                           | Key Managed By      | Can Be Shared Across Subscriptions? | Can Be Shared Across Tenants? |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------- | ----------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| **PMK** (Platform-managed key) | Microsoft (default) | ✅ Yes                              | ✅ Yes                        |
| **CMK** (Customer-managed key) | You (via Key Vault) | ⚠️ Limited                          | ❌ Not supported              |

## 🧠 What's the Issue with CMK Sharing?

Azure snapshots encrypted with your **own CMK** are **tied to your subscription and tenant**.

- ❌ You **cannot share or move** CMK-encrypted snapshots **across tenants**
- ⚠️ You **cannot move** CMK snapshots **between subscriptions** even within the same tenant
- ✅ You **can only reuse CMK snapshots** within the **same subscription**

> Unlike AWS (where you can share CMK snapshots across accounts by granting KMS access), Azure restricts CMK use to your current subscription/tenant.

## ✅ Want to Share Snapshots? Use PMK

If your goal is to:

- Share snapshots across subscriptions
- Copy snapshots across tenants
- Use the snapshot as a base image in another environment

Then **use PMK-encrypted snapshots**.

### Example Sharing Flow (PMK):

```bash
# Grant access to snapshot
az role assignment create \
  --assignee <target-subscription-service-principal-or-user> \
  --role "Reader" \
  --scope "/subscriptions/<your-sub>/resourceGroups/<rg>/providers/Microsoft.Compute/snapshots/<snapshot-name>"

# Target subscription can now copy it
az snapshot create \
  --name "copy-of-shared-snap" \
  --resource-group "target-rg" \
  --source "/subscriptions/<your-sub>/resourceGroups/<rg>/providers/Microsoft.Compute/snapshots/<snapshot-name>" \
  --location eastus
```

---

## 🧩 Workaround for CMK Snapshots

If your snapshot is encrypted with **CMK**, and you need to share it:

❌ You cannot directly share it.

✅ You can **create a new PMK-encrypted snapshot** from the disk temporarily, then share that copy:

```bash
# Create a new snapshot from CMK disk using PMK
az snapshot create \
  --name "pmk-copy" \
  --resource-group "rg" \
  --source "/subscriptions/xxx/.../disks/mycmkdisk" \
  --encryption-type EncryptionAtRestWithPlatformKey \
  --location eastus
```

Then proceed to share the PMK snapshot.

## 📦 Final Summary

| Goal                                     | Use PMK | Use CMK |
| ---------------------------------------- | ------- | ------- |
| Share snapshot across subscriptions      | ✅      | ❌      |
| Share snapshot across tenants            | ✅      | ❌      |
| Use Key Vault to manage encryption       | ❌      | ✅      |
| Full control over encryption lifecycle   | ❌      | ✅      |
| Most flexible sharing (like AWS default) | ✅      | ❌      |

---

> 💬 **TL;DR**:
> If you're building shared base images across environments, stick to **PMK**.
> If you're doing sensitive compliance encryption, use **CMK**, but don't expect portability like in AWS unless you're staying within one subscription.
