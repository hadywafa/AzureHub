# 🔀 What Is Message Routing?

Message routing means:  
**How messages move from one app to another** using queues or topics.

Think of it like sending packages:

- A queue is like a single mailbox.
- A topic is like a post office that copies your package to multiple mailboxes.

### 1️⃣ **Simple Request/Reply**

- You send a message to a queue.
- One service picks it up, processes it, and replies.
- ✅ One sender → one receiver → one reply.

**Example**:  
You ask the inventory service: “Do we have item X?”  
It replies: “Yes, 10 in stock.”

---

### 2️⃣ **Multicast with Topics**

- You send one message to a topic.
- The topic sends a copy to multiple subscriptions.
- Each subscription has one receiver.

**Example**:  
You place an order →  
Billing, Shipping, and Notification services all get notified.

✅ One message → many receivers (each gets their own copy).

---

### 3️⃣ **Multiplexing**

- You send different types of messages to the same queue.
- The receiver checks the message type and handles it accordingly.

**Example**:  
Queue receives both “Order” and “Shipment” messages.  
The app reads `MessageType` and decides what to do.

✅ One queue → smart receiver → handles multiple types.

---

### 4️⃣ **Multiplexed Request/Reply**

- You send one request.
- Multiple services reply separately.
- You use a `CorrelationId` to group the replies.

**Example**:  
Loan request goes to Credit Check, Risk Check, and Compliance.  
Each replies with their result.  
You group replies using the same ID.

✅ One request → multiple replies → grouped by ID.

## 🧠 What Is Correlation?

**Correlation** means:  
How you link messages that belong to the same workflow.

### Key Properties:

| Property        | What It Does                          |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| `MessageId`     | Unique ID for each message            |
| `CorrelationId` | Links replies to the original request |
| `SessionId`     | Keeps messages in order per user      |
| `ReplyTo`       | Tells where to send the response      |
| `MessageType`   | Helps route different message types   |
