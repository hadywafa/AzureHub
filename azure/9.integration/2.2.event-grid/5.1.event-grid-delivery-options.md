# 🚚 **Azure Event Grid – Event Delivery Options**

Azure Event Grid is like the **delivery guy of events**.  
It takes events from **publishers** (Blob Storage, IoT Hub, Custom Apps…) and makes sure they reach the right **subscribers** (Functions, Queues, APIs…).

But how does Event Grid _actually_ deliver those events? That’s where **delivery options** come in.

---

## 🌐 1. **Webhooks** (The Default & Most Common)

- **What it is:** Event Grid sends an **HTTP POST** with event JSON to your URL endpoint.
- **You need:**

  - A public endpoint (like `https://myapp.com/events`).
  - To handle the **`handshake validation`** when the subscription is created.

- **Use case:**

  - A custom API that receives `BlobCreated` events and updates your app’s database.

💡 **AWS Equivalent:** SNS → HTTPS/HTTP endpoint.

---

## ⚡ 2. **Azure Functions** (Event Grid Trigger)

- **What it is:** A **serverless function** that runs automatically on new events.
- **Why it’s awesome:**

  - You don’t need to manage webhook validation.
  - Functions scale automatically with event volume.

- **Use case:**

  - New IoT data arrives → Function normalizes the payload and saves it to Cosmos DB.

💡 **AWS Equivalent:** S3 → Lambda event triggers.

---

## 🔧 3. **Azure Logic Apps** (Event Grid Connector)

- **What it is:** A **low-code workflow** that starts whenever an Event Grid event fires.
- **Why it’s nice:**

  - No need to copy-paste webhook URLs.
  - Drag-and-drop automation (email, approvals, integrations).

- **Use case:**

  - Blob uploaded → Logic App sends an email to the marketing team.

💡 **AWS Equivalent:** Step Functions triggered by events (but Logic Apps are more drag-and-drop).

---

## 🤖 4. **Azure Automation Runbooks** (Webhook Style)

- **What it is:** A **script (PowerShell/Python)** that runs when Event Grid POSTs to its webhook.
- **Why use it:** Great for **infra automation**.
- **Use case:**

  - A VM gets deleted → Runbook cleans up orphaned disks and NICs.

💡 **AWS Equivalent:** Lambda + Systems Manager Automation.

---

## 📡 5. **Azure Messaging Services**

When you don’t want direct execution, you can push events into **queues/streams** first:

- **Event Hubs** → Big data streaming (millions of events/sec).

  - Example: Stream IoT telemetry into Event Hubs → process with Stream Analytics.

- **Service Bus** → Enterprise-grade workflows with ordering, retries, dead-lettering.

  - Example: Send order events to Service Bus for ERP integration.

- **Storage Queue** → Simple, cheap, reliable queue.

  - Example: Drop events into a queue for batch worker processing.

💡 **AWS Equivalent:**

- Event Hubs ≈ Kinesis
- Service Bus ≈ SQS + SNS + FIFO
- Storage Queue ≈ SQS Standard

## ✅ **When to Use What?**

| Option            | Best For              | Pros                           | Cons                             |
| ----------------- | --------------------- | ------------------------------ | -------------------------------- |
| **Webhook**       | Custom apps/APIs      | Flexible, any language         | Must handle validation & scaling |
| **Functions**     | Serverless processing | Auto-scale, native integration | Short-lived tasks only           |
| **Logic Apps**    | Low-code automation   | Easy to set up                 | Slower, costs per action         |
| **Runbooks**      | Infra automation      | Great for ops                  | Not real-time fast               |
| **Event Hubs**    | Analytics/streaming   | High throughput                | Extra cost/complexity            |
| **Service Bus**   | Enterprise workflows  | Ordered, durable               | More config                      |
| **Storage Queue** | Simple queueing       | Cheap, easy                    | Basic features only              |

---

## 🏆 **Summary**

- **Webhook** = direct HTTP POST → you own the code.
- **Functions / Logic Apps / Runbooks** = Azure-managed automation options.
- **Event Hubs / Service Bus / Storage Queue** = messaging-based delivery.

👉 The key: **Pick the delivery option that matches your workload** (real-time trigger vs queued workflow vs high-throughput streaming).
