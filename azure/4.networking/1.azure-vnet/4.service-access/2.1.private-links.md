# üîó Azure Private Link ‚Äî **Private Endpoint vs Private Link Service**

## üö® **The Problem It Solves**

Before Private Link existed, Azure PaaS services (like Storage, SQL, Key Vault) were accessible only via **public IP addresses** (even if traffic stayed on Microsoft‚Äôs backbone when using **Service Endpoints**).

- Public exposure increases **attack surface**.
- Customers in regulated industries need **no-internet paths** for compliance.
- Partners (ISVs, SaaS providers) want to expose services **privately** to customers **without** creating **VPN tunnels** or **peering VNets**.

üí° **Private Link** solves both by **embedding the service directly into your VNet via a private IP**.

| Term                           | Meaning                                                                                                                                                                  |

| **Private Endpoint (PE)**      | A network interface with a private IP in your subnet that connects securely to an Azure PaaS resource (Storage, SQL, Key Vault, etc.) or to a Private Link Service.      |
| **Private Link Service (PLS)** | A way for you (or a partner) to expose **your own service** privately over Private Link so that consumers in other VNets (or tenants) can connect via Private Endpoints. |
| **Private DNS Zone**           | Overrides public DNS names to point to the private IP address of the PE.                                                                                                 |

## üìå **Two Faces of Private Link**

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Private Endpoint for Azure Resources**

- **Purpose:** Securely access **Microsoft-managed PaaS services** (Azure Storage, SQL Database, Key Vault, etc.) via private IP.
- **How:** Azure provisions a NIC in your subnet linked to the PaaS resource.
- **Traffic Flow:**

  ```plaintext
  VM (10.0.0.4) ‚Üí Private IP (PE) ‚Üí Azure Backbone ‚Üí Azure PaaS Service
  ```

- **Example:**
  You have an Azure Storage account `mystorage.blob.core.windows.net`.
  Normally, this resolves to a public IP like `52.x.x.x`.
  With Private Endpoint:

  - DNS now resolves to `10.0.1.5` (private IP in your subnet).
  - Public network access to the storage can be disabled.

- **_Private Endpoint:_**

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Private Link Service for Partner or Custom Services**

- **Purpose:** Expose **your own service** running behind an Azure Standard Load Balancer privately to other VNets or tenants.
- **How:**

  - You (Provider) create a **Private Link Service** linked to your Standard Load Balancer frontend.
  - Consumers connect via **Private Endpoints** in their VNets.
  - Traffic flows **over Azure backbone**, never touching the internet.

- **Traffic Flow:**

  ```plaintext
  Consumer VM (10.10.0.4) ‚Üí Private Endpoint ‚Üí Azure Backbone ‚Üí Provider Load Balancer ‚Üí Backend VM/App
  ```

- **Example:**
  A SaaS company in Azure hosts an API for multiple enterprise customers.
  Instead of exposing it over a public IP:

  - They publish a **Private Link Service**.
  - Each customer gets a **Private Endpoint** in their own VNet pointing to that service.
  - The API appears like it‚Äôs inside the customer‚Äôs network.

- **_Private Link Service:_**

## üîÑ **Commonality ‚Äî Both Use Private IP Links**

Whether it‚Äôs **Private Endpoint** to Azure PaaS or **Private Endpoint** to a partner‚Äôs **Private Link Service**:

- A **private IP** is allocated in your subnet.
- All traffic uses Azure‚Äôs private backbone.
- The only visible IP to you is that private IP.

## ‚úçüèª **Hands-On Examples**

### üìå **Example 1 ‚Äî Private Endpoint to Azure SQL**

1. Go to your SQL Server ‚Üí Networking ‚Üí **Private endpoint connections** ‚Üí **+ Private endpoint**.
2. Choose your VNet + Subnet.
3. Create Private DNS Zone: `privatelink.database.windows.net`.
4. Test:

   ```bash
   nslookup mydb.database.windows.net
   # Returns 10.x.x.x
   ```

### üìå **Example 2 ‚Äî Private Link Service for Partner API**

**Provider Side:**

1. Create a Standard Load Balancer for backend VMs.
2. Publish **Private Link Service** pointing to the Load Balancer.
3. Share the **Resource ID** or **Alias** with the consumer.

**Consumer Side:**

1. Create Private Endpoint ‚Üí **Connect to resource by alias**.
2. Wait for Provider to approve.
3. Test:

   ```bash
   curl https://partnerapi.privatelink.azure.com
   ```

## üß† AWS Analogy

| Private Endpoint (Azure Resources) | VPC Endpoint (Interface Type)                 |
| Private Link Service               | AWS PrivateLink (for Partner/Custom Services) |
| Private DNS Zone                   | AWS Private Hosted Zone                       |

## üö® Gotchas

- Without **Private DNS Zone**, your VMs may still resolve to public IPs.
- **Private Link Service** needs **Standard Load Balancer**, not Basic.
- Disable public access on PaaS resources to fully enforce private-only access.

## üßëüèª‚Äçüíª Practice

If you want, I can now make a **side-by-side lab** where we:

1. Create a Private Endpoint to Azure SQL.
2. Create a Private Link Service from a web API and connect as a consumer.
3. Show how DNS overrides the public IP in both cases.

This would give you **real muscle memory** between the two.

Do you want me to prepare that lab next?
