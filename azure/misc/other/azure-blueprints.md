# 🖨️ Azure Blueprints

**Azure Blueprints was a governance and deployment service that allowed organizations to define repeatable, compliant environments in Azure—but it’s being deprecated by July 2026. Microsoft recommends migrating to Template Specs and Deployment Stacks.**

## 🧠 What Was Azure Blueprints?

Azure Blueprints enabled cloud architects to **package infrastructure, policies, and access controls** into a single, versioned blueprint. Think of it as a **deployment sketch** that ensures every environment follows organizational standards.

### 🔧 Core Components of a Blueprint:

- **Resource Groups**: Logical containers for resources.
- **ARM Templates**: Define infrastructure (VMs, networks, etc.).
- **Policy Assignments**: Enforce rules (e.g., allowed VM sizes).
- **Role Assignments**: Control access via RBAC.

Each blueprint could be **assigned to a subscription**, ensuring consistent deployment across environments.

---

## 📦 Blueprint Lifecycle

1. **Define**: Create a blueprint with artifacts (templates, policies, roles).
2. **Version**: Track changes over time.
3. **Assign**: Deploy the blueprint to a subscription.
4. **Audit**: Monitor compliance and deployment status.

This lifecycle supported **CI/CD pipelines**, making it ideal for DevOps workflows.

## 🔐 Governance Benefits

- **Compliance enforcement**: Ensures every deployment meets regulatory and internal standards.
- **Standardization**: Reduces drift across environments.
- **Auditability**: Maintains a link between blueprint definition and deployment.

## ⚠️ Deprecation Notice

Microsoft will **retire Azure Blueprints on July 11, 2026**. Recommended migration paths:

- **Template Specs**: Store and version ARM/Bicep templates natively in Azure.
- **Deployment Stacks**: Group resources for lifecycle management and rollback.

Blueprint artifacts should be **converted to ARM JSON or Bicep files** for future use.

## 🧪 Real-World Use Case (Before Deprecation)

Imagine you’re onboarding a new team:

- You assign a blueprint that deploys:
  - A secure VNet
  - A VM with monitoring
  - Policies restricting public IPs
  - RBAC for team leads
- The team starts with a **compliant, ready-to-use environment**—no manual setup.
