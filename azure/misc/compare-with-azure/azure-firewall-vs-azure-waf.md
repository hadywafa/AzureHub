# ‚öîÔ∏è Azure Firewall vs Web Application Firewall (WAF)

| Feature / Purpose     | **Azure Firewall**                                                                      | **Web Application Firewall (WAF)**                                                                        |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **OSI Layer**         | Layer 3 & 4 (Network + Transport)                                                       | Layer 7 (Application / HTTP)                                                                              |
| **Primary Use Case**  | Secure and filter _network traffic_ across VNets, subnets, and on-premises connections. | Protect _web applications_ from application-layer attacks like SQL injection, XSS, and request smuggling. |
| **Understands HTTP?** | ‚ùå No ‚Äî it only filters based on IPs, ports, protocols.                                 | ‚úÖ Yes ‚Äî it inspects HTTP/S requests and applies OWASP rules.                                             |
| **SSL Termination**   | ‚ùå Not supported (it doesn‚Äôt decrypt HTTPS traffic).                                    | ‚úÖ Performs SSL termination and deep inspection of web traffic.                                           |
| **Integration Point** | Typically sits at the **network perimeter** (e.g. hub VNet).                            | Sits **in front of web apps** (e.g. Application Gateway or Azure Front Door).                             |
| **Scenarios**         | Outbound filtering, DNAT/SNAT, network segmentation, egress control, logging.           | Defend against OWASP Top 10 web vulnerabilities, bot protection, rate limiting, custom rules.             |
| **Example**           | Block all traffic except HTTPS to certain IPs.                                          | Block requests containing `<script>` or SQL keywords in a URL parameter.                                  |

## üåê In This Question‚Äôs Context

> You are designing a **web application** that needs:
>
> - Advanced **traffic management**
> - **SSL termination**
> - **Multi-site routing**
> - Protection from **web vulnerabilities**

Let‚Äôs analyze:

### üîπ To manage web traffic, SSL termination, and multi-site routing

‚û°Ô∏è You need a **Layer 7 load balancer** ‚Üí
‚úÖ **Azure Application Gateway (v2)** or **Azure Front Door (Premium)**

These services:

- Terminate SSL/TLS (HTTPS offloading)
- Route traffic based on hostname/path
- Integrate WAF
- Scale automatically

### üîπ To enhance security against web vulnerabilities

‚û°Ô∏è You need **Azure Web Application Firewall (WAF)**

- Built into Application Gateway (regional) or Front Door (global)
- Uses OWASP Core Rule Sets
- Protects against SQL injection, XSS, and malicious bots

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Why **Azure Firewall** Is NOT Correct Here

- It can‚Äôt handle HTTPS termination or inspect HTTP requests.
- It doesn‚Äôt support multi-site routing or URL-based routing.
- It operates at **Layer 3/4**, while the requirement (SSL termination + app-layer filtering) is **Layer 7**.
- It‚Äôs often used **together** with Application Gateway/WAF, not _instead of_ it.

## ‚úÖ Final Design Recommendation

| Purpose                                                     | Azure Service                                                      | Why                                                                                                   |
| ----------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Traffic management, SSL termination, multi-site routing** | **Azure Application Gateway (v2)** or **Azure Front Door Premium** | Provides HTTPS load balancing, global routing, and scaling.                                           |
| **Web security (app-layer protection)**                     | **Web Application Firewall (WAF)**                                 | Protects against OWASP Top 10 threats and malicious HTTP traffic.                                     |
| _(Optional ‚Äì network layer defense)_                        | **Azure Firewall**                                                 | Can sit in hub VNet for egress control and hybrid connectivity, but **not** for web-layer protection. |

### üèÅ Summary

- **Azure Firewall** = Network security (Layer 3/4)
- **WAF (via App Gateway / Front Door)** = Web app protection (Layer 7)
- **For AZ-305 design** ‚Üí
  ‚úÖ Application Gateway or Front Door (for traffic + SSL)
  ‚úÖ WAF (for web security)
