# üßë‚Äçüíº Types of Identities in Microsoft Entra ID

Microsoft Entra ID supports multiple identity types to handle **users, guests, devices, apps**, and even **workloads** (non-human accounts).

Let‚Äôs explore them in a clean table first, then go deep with fun examples and comparisons. üëá

## üì¶ Identity Types Overview

| Identity Type         | Description                                      | Example Use Case                                |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------- |
| **Member User**       | Internal org user with full access to tenant     | Employees with `@company.com`                   |
| **Guest User (B2B)**  | External users from other tenants/orgs           | Partner or contractor accessing your Teams site |
| **External User**     | Any user outside the tenant                      | Gmail/Outlook users invited to collaborate      |
| **Service Principal** | App identity used for automation or sign-in      | Azure DevOps pipeline login                     |
| **Managed Identity**  | Auto-managed identity for Azure services         | Azure Function accessing Key Vault              |
| **Device Identity**   | Registered computers/mobile devices              | Intune-managed Windows laptops                  |
| **Group Identity**    | Container of users/devices for RBAC and policies | `Finance-Team`, `All-Admins`                    |
| **Workload Identity** | Identity for non-human workloads/apps/scripts    | Azure app running as a "system" user            |

---

## üßç‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è 1. **Member Users** (aka "Employees")

> These are users **created inside your tenant** with your own domain.

- **UPN format**: `alex@contoso.com`
- **Who**: Internal employees or accounts created manually via Azure or synced from on-prem AD (via Entra Connect)
- **Permissions**: Full RBAC access (based on roles)
- **Best For**: Staff, Admins, Internal Teams

üìå **Common Sources**:

- Created manually in portal
- Synced from on-prem Active Directory
- Via user provisioning APIs

---

## üß≥ 2. **Guest Users** (B2B Collaboration)

> These are **external users invited** from another Microsoft Entra tenant.

- **UPN format**: `username_domain.com#EXT#@yourtenant.onmicrosoft.com`
- **Who**: External consultants, suppliers, or other org users
- **Permissions**: Limited by default (can be extended with RBAC)
- **Best For**: Sharing access to Teams, SharePoint, or Azure Resources

üìå Guest users use **Azure AD B2B collaboration**, allowing them to:

- Authenticate with their home credentials
- Be governed by your policies (like Conditional Access, MFA, etc.)

üß† **AWS Comparison**: This is like **IAM Role Switching or STS AssumeRole**, but more structured.

---

## üëΩ 3. **External Identities** (Not Just Guests)

> Broader than just B2B ‚Äî includes **social, federated, or non-Azure AD** users

- **Examples**:

  - Google/Gmail accounts
  - Facebook (via Azure AD B2C)
  - GitHub users accessing DevOps pipelines

‚úÖ Works via **Federated Authentication**  
‚úÖ Used in **Entra External ID**, **Azure AD B2C**, or **Cross-Tenant Access**

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è 4. **Service Principals** (Apps Acting as Users)

> A **Service Principal (SP)** is the identity of an app **registered** in Entra ID.

- Used for:

  - Azure DevOps pipelines
  - Azure CLI login scripts
  - Terraform deployments

- Created automatically when you register an app or assign a permission

üß† Think of this as an **application identity** ‚Äî it doesn‚Äôt have a username/password (unless you give it one or a secret/cert).

üîí Can be **granted permissions** on subscriptions, resources, or APIs

---

## ü§ñ 5. **Managed Identities** (Azure Services as Users)

> Built-in identity for Azure services ‚Äî no password, no secret rotation!

- **Types**:

  - **System-assigned**: Bound to a single resource (VM, Function, etc.)
  - **User-assigned**: A reusable identity shared across resources

üß™ Example:

> Azure Function uses Managed Identity to get secrets from Key Vault, without storing a secret in code.

‚úÖ No manual credential management  
‚úÖ Works with RBAC and Azure SDKs  
‚úÖ Secure and automated

---

## üíª 6. **Device Identities**

> When devices (laptops, phones) **register or join Entra ID**, they get their own identity.

- Used with **Conditional Access**, **Intune**, **Compliance Policies**
- Key for **Zero Trust** and hybrid identity scenarios
- Examples:

  - `WIN-1234567890` (Windows Autopilot enrolled)
  - Corporate iPhones in Intune

üß† Device identities let you control access based on **device trust & compliance status**

---

## üßë‚Äçü§ù‚Äçüßë 7. **Group Identities**

> Logical containers that hold users, devices, or other groups.

- Types:

  - **Security Groups**: Used for RBAC, policies, access
  - **Microsoft 365 Groups**: Collaboration-based (Teams, Outlook)
  - **Dynamic Groups**: Auto-populate based on user/device attributes

üß™ Example:

> Assign `Reader` role to the `Analytics-Team` group on a subscription ‚Äî all members inherit it.

---

## üßë‚Äçüíª 8. **Workload Identities**

> Identities **used by applications, scripts, or tools**, with support for **OpenID Connect (OIDC)** and OAuth2 flows.

- Entra ID supports:

  - Workload identity federation (e.g., GitHub Actions OIDC login)
  - Cross-cloud federation
  - External service-to-service auth

üß™ Example:

> A GitHub Action authenticates to Azure using workload identity federation ‚Äî no secret needed.

‚úÖ Secure  
‚úÖ Passwordless  
‚úÖ Used in modern DevOps pipelines

| ----------------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Member User       | Entra native user             | IAM user (within AWS account)        |
| Guest User        | B2B user from other tenant    | IAM cross-account role (kind of)     |
| Managed Identity  | Built-in to Azure services    | EC2 Instance Profile (with IAM role) |
| Service Principal | App identity                  | IAM Role with programmatic access    |
| Group Identity    | Azure security group          | IAM group                            |
| Device Identity   | Registered device in Entra ID | Device trust policy (via SSO/SSO+)   |
| External Identity | B2C or Federated              | Cognito Federated Identity / IAM IdP |

## üß† Final Tips

- Use **Managed Identities** for Azure services whenever possible. No secrets = no leaks.
- Add **Guest Users** using B2B for external collaboration with Teams, SharePoint, or Azure.
- Use **Dynamic Groups** for auto-access assignment based on job title, location, etc.
- **Federate GitHub Actions or other CI/CD tools** using **OIDC Workload Identities**.
