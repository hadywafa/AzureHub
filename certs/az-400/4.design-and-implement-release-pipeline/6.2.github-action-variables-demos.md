# 🧪 GitHub Actions Variables — Practical Examples for Each Type

## 🏷️ 1. **System Variables** (Built-in, Read-only)

Automatically provided by GitHub. You **do not define** these.

```yaml
jobs:
  show-system-vars:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - run: echo "Triggered by $GITHUB_ACTOR"
      - run: echo "Running on $GITHUB_REF"
      - run: echo "Workflow: $GITHUB_WORKFLOW"
      - run: echo "Commit: $GITHUB_SHA"
```

---

## ✍️ 2. **User-Defined Variables** (env block)

### 🔹 Global level

```yaml
env:
  NODE_ENV: production
  API_URL: https://api.example.com

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - run: echo "Env is $NODE_ENV and API is $API_URL"
```

### 🔹 Job-level

```yaml
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    env:
      PLATFORM: linux
    steps:
      - run: echo "Building on $PLATFORM"
```

### 🔹 Step-level

```yaml
jobs:
  one-step:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Custom ENV for this step
        env:
          STAGE: debug
        run: echo "Step running in $STAGE mode"
```

---

## 🌍 3. **Environment Variables** (Reusable across steps)

Defined using `env:` in workflows, jobs, or steps.

```yaml
env:
  PACKAGE_VERSION: 2.1.3

jobs:
  version-check:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - run: echo "Deploying version $PACKAGE_VERSION"
```

Can also be referenced as `${{ env.PACKAGE_VERSION }}`

---

## 🛡️ 4. **Secrets** (Secure, Encrypted)

You define these via GitHub UI → `Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions`.

### 🔐 a. Repository Secret

```yaml
jobs:
  auth:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Use API Key
        run: curl -H "Authorization: Bearer ${{ secrets.API_KEY }}" https://api.example.com
```

### 🏢 b. Organization Secret

Used in the same way — just scoped org-wide and optionally limited to specific repos.

### 🌳 c. Environment Secret

```yaml
jobs:
  deploy:
    environment: production
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Upload artifact to S3
        run: aws s3 cp file.zip s3://mybucket/
        env:
          AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID: ${{ secrets.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID }}
          AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY: ${{ secrets.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY }}
```

🔐 Environment secrets are scoped to environments (like `dev`, `test`, `prod`) and can have **approval gates** configured.
