# ‚ÅâÔ∏è Git LFS Questions

## ‚ùì1. How to Apply Git LFS to an Existing Repo with Binary Files?

If your repo already has large/binary files committed **without** LFS, here‚Äôs the right process to transition:

---

### üßº Option A: Start Tracking New Binaries with LFS (Going Forward)

This is the **simplest and safest option**, especially for teams.

#### ‚úÖ Steps:

```bash
# 1. Install Git LFS
git lfs install

# 2. Track file types
git lfs track "*.mp4"
git lfs track "*.psd"
git add .gitattributes

# 3. From now on, binaries will be added as LFS pointers
git add newfile.mp4
git commit -m "Start using LFS for new .mp4 files"
```

üî∏ **Drawback**: Old commits and files are still in Git history (large repo size remains)
üî∏ **Upside**: No rewriting history = no risk, easy to implement

---

### üîÑ Option B: Migrate Existing Binaries into LFS (Full Conversion)

If you want to **fully move old binary files into LFS** (including old history), use:

```bash
# WARNING: This rewrites Git history!
git lfs migrate import --include="*.mp4,*.psd"
```

This:

- Rewrites Git history
- Replaces past committed binaries with LFS pointers
- Uploads the binaries to the LFS server

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes:

| Thing to Know                           | Why it Matters                      |
| --------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| üî• Rewrites **entire Git history**      | All team members must re-clone repo |
| üß™ Use only in **early-stage projects** | Or you risk breaking forks/clones   |
| ‚úÖ Great for archive/long-term repo     | If size cleanup is a top priority   |

---

## ‚ùì2. What If a New Dev Forgets to Use Git LFS?

This is **very common** in teams! Here's what happens and how to handle it:

---

### üîç Problem

- New dev clones the repo but **doesn‚Äôt run `git lfs install`**
- They commit a `.zip` or `.mp4` directly to Git
- Result: The binary goes into `.git/objects`, **bloats the repo**, and **bypasses LFS**

---

### üõ°Ô∏è Solution A: Enforce LFS via `.gitattributes`

`.gitattributes` is like a **tracking contract** between Git and the dev.

#### Example:

```text
*.mp4 filter=lfs diff=lfs merge=lfs -text
*.zip filter=lfs diff=lfs merge=lfs -text
```

‚úÖ If the dev has Git LFS installed ‚Äî files go into LFS
‚ùå If they **don‚Äôt**, Git warns or breaks the commit

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è But: This **doesn‚Äôt prevent them** from adding other binary types accidentally.

---

### üõë Solution B: Pre-Commit Hook to Block Large Binaries

You can enforce rules locally or via CI:

#### Example `pre-commit` Git hook:

```bash
#!/bin/sh
# Block binaries > 5MB that are NOT LFS tracked
maxsize=5242880
for file in $(git diff --cached --name-only); do
  if [ -f "$file" ] && [ $(stat -c%s "$file") -gt $maxsize ]; then
    if ! git check-attr filter -- "$file" | grep -q 'filter: lfs'; then
      echo "‚ùå File $file is over 5MB and not tracked by Git LFS."
      exit 1
    fi
  fi
done
```

‚úÖ Blocks commits of big binaries unless tracked by LFS
‚úÖ Works even if the developer forgets to `lfs install`

---

### üß™ Solution C: CI Pipeline Check (GitHub Actions, Azure DevOps)

In CI, you can add a script to **fail the pipeline** if:

- Any binary file (e.g. `.mp4`, `.zip`, `.bin`) is committed without being in LFS
- Use tools like `git-lfs-pre-push` or custom scripts

---

### üïµÔ∏è Solution D: Scan the Repo for Existing Binaries

```bash
git verify-lfs
```

Or manually list large files:

```bash
git rev-list --objects --all | \
  git cat-file --batch-check='%(objecttype) %(objectname) %(objectsize) %(rest)' | \
  grep '^blob' | \
  sort -k3 -n | \
  tail -n 10
```

You‚Äôll see **huge binary blobs** and can manually migrate them via:

```bash
git lfs migrate import --include="*.mp4"
```

---

## ‚úÖ Final Summary

| Situation                       | Best Action                                   |
| ------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| You want to use LFS on old repo | Use `git lfs track` + commit `.gitattributes` |
| You want to migrate history     | Use `git lfs migrate import` (with care!)     |
| New dev skips LFS               | Use `.gitattributes` + pre-commit hooks       |
| Prevent large file pollution    | Use hooks or CI to block non-LFS binaries     |
| Want to audit existing bloat    | Use `rev-list` + `git lfs migrate`            |
