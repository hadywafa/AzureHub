# 🚦 Azure DevOps Pipeline Types (Build, Release, Multi-Stage)

> Azure DevOps Pipelines support multiple ways to automate CI/CD workflows.
>
> 1. 🧱 Build Pipelines (CI)
> 2. 🚀 Release Pipelines (CD)
> 3. 🌀 Multi-Stage Pipelines (Build + Deploy)

## 🧱 1. Build Pipelines (CI)

**Purpose**: 🏗️ Compile code, run tests, produce artifacts
**Also Known As**: CI Pipelines

### 🔍 What It Does:

- Triggers on code changes (push, PR, schedule)
- Builds and tests code automatically
- Produces deployable **artifacts** (.zip, .jar, .dll, etc.)

### 📄 Can Be Created Using:

| Method     | Description                           |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------- |
| YAML       | Pipeline-as-code (recommended)        |
| Classic UI | Drag-and-drop tasks (legacy/friendly) |

### 🧪 Example YAML CI Pipeline

```yaml
trigger:
  branches:
    include:
      - main

pool:
  vmImage: "ubuntu-latest"

steps:
  - task: DotNetCoreCLI@2
    inputs:
      command: "build"
      projects: "**/*.csproj"

  - task: PublishBuildArtifacts@1
    inputs:
      pathToPublish: "$(Build.ArtifactStagingDirectory)"
      artifactName: "drop"
```

## 🚀 2. Release Pipelines (CD)

**Purpose**: 🚚 Deploy built artifacts to target environments
**Also Known As**: CD Pipelines (Classic)

### 🧰 Key Features:

- Deploys artifacts created by a **Build Pipeline**
- Supports **multiple environments** (Dev, QA, Prod)
- Allows **manual approvals, gates, variables**, and rollback
- Configured visually via **Classic UI** or **YAML**

### 💡 Common Use Case:

- Build artifacts once
- Promote to environments using approval-based stages

### 🖱️ Classic UI Example (Visual)

- Drag-and-drop stages (e.g., Dev → QA → Prod)
- Define release conditions and deployment agents
- Set pre/post-approvals

> 🔐 Still useful for large enterprise teams who need manual gatekeeping.

## 🌀 3. Multi-Stage Pipelines (CI + CD in YAML)

**Purpose**: 📦 Combine build and deploy logic in a single YAML file
**Also Known As**: Unified YAML Pipelines

### ✨ Why Use It?

- Modern, version-controlled pipeline
- Combines CI (Build) + CD (Deploy) in one file
- Supports environments, approvals, conditions, and more

### 🧪 Example YAML Multi-Stage Pipeline

```yaml
trigger:
  branches:
    include:
      - main

stages:
  - stage: Build
    jobs:
      - job: BuildJob
        steps:
          - script: dotnet build
          - task: PublishBuildArtifacts@1
            inputs:
              pathToPublish: "$(Build.ArtifactStagingDirectory)"
              artifactName: "drop"

  - stage: Deploy
    dependsOn: Build
    jobs:
      - deployment: DeployJob
        environment: staging
        strategy:
          runOnce:
            deploy:
              steps:
                - task: AzureWebApp@1
                  inputs:
                    appName: "my-web-app"
                    package: "$(Pipeline.Workspace)/drop/*.zip"
```

## 🔄 Comparison: Build vs Release vs Multi-Stage

| Feature             | Build Pipeline | Release Pipeline (Classic) | Multi-Stage Pipeline (YAML)        |
| ------------------- | -------------- | -------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Purpose             | Build & Test   | Deploy                     | Build + Deploy                     |
| Artifact Handling   | Produces       | Consumes                   | Produces & Consumes inline         |
| Environment Support | ❌ Basic       | ✅ Advanced                | ✅ Advanced                        |
| Manual Approvals    | ❌             | ✅ Yes                     | ✅ With `environments` + approvals |
| UI Method           | YAML / Classic | Classic UI Only            | YAML Only                          |
| Best For            | CI             | Visual CD for Enterprises  | Unified CI/CD with code management |

## 🧠 Summary: Which Pipeline Type to Use?

| Situation                              | Recommended Pipeline Type        |
| -------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Simple CI only                         | ✅ Build Pipeline (YAML)         |
| Deploy to multiple envs with approvals | ✅ Release Pipeline (Classic)    |
| Full CI/CD in one place (modern style) | ✅ Multi-Stage Pipeline (YAML)   |
| Need visual drag-drop deployments      | ✅ Release Pipeline (Classic UI) |
| Version-controlled DevOps infra        | ✅ Multi-Stage (YAML)            |

## 🧰 Final Tips

- 🎯 Use **Multi-Stage YAML** for modern, end-to-end automation
- 🧱 Use **Classic UI Releases** only if you need visual gates/approvals
- ✏️ Always version your pipelines with Git
- 🔒 Use Environments + Approvals for production safety
