# üßæ Azure DevOps YAML Pipeline Schema ‚Äì Full Breakdown

> The **YAML schema** defines how Azure DevOps pipelines are written as code.  
> It's the foundation of pipeline-as-code, offering a declarative way to define all build/test/deploy automation in one `.yml` file.

---

## üìÅ Where Does YAML Live?

Your YAML file is usually:

- Named: `azure-pipelines.yml`
- Placed at the root of your repo
- Connected via **default branch pipeline trigger**, or manually set in Azure DevOps UI

---

## üß† YAML Pipeline Basic Anatomy

Here‚Äôs a top-down structure of everything in YAML pipelines:

```yaml
# ‚úÖ Full Structure Skeleton
trigger: # When pipeline runs
variables: # Global/shared variables
stages: # Top-level grouping of work (build/test/deploy)
  - stage: # Stage name
    displayName: # (Optional) Friendly name
    jobs:
      - job: # A job runs on a single agent
        steps: # The tasks/scripts inside that job
          - task: # Built-in task
          - script: # Inline command
```

---

## üß™ Real YAML Example

```yaml
trigger:
  branches:
    include:
      - main

variables:
  buildConfiguration: "Release"
  nodeVersion: "18.x"

stages:
  - stage: Build
    displayName: "üîß Build Stage"
    jobs:
      - job: BuildJob
        pool:
          vmImage: "ubuntu-latest"
        steps:
          - task: UseNode@1
            inputs:
              version: $(nodeVersion)
          - script: npm install
            displayName: "üì¶ Install Packages"
          - script: npm run build
            displayName: "üèóÔ∏è Build App"
          - task: PublishBuildArtifacts@1
            inputs:
              PathtoPublish: "dist"
              ArtifactName: "app"
```

## üß± Major Schema Sections Explained

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ `trigger`

Controls which branches will trigger the pipeline automatically.

```yaml
trigger:
  branches:
    include:
      - main
```

> You can also exclude branches or set path filters.

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ `pr`

Defines pull request triggers.

```yaml
pr:
  branches:
    include:
      - dev
```

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ `variables`

- Define key/value pairs used throughout the pipeline.
- Can be scoped globally, per stage, per job, or per step.

```yaml
variables:
  environment: "staging"
```

Advanced:

```yaml
variables:
  - name: isProduction
    value: $[eq(variables['Build.SourceBranch'], 'refs/heads/main')]
```

---

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ `stages`

- High-level sections of the pipeline (e.g., Build, Test, Deploy)
- Run sequentially by default but can be configured to run in parallel.

```yaml
stages:
  - stage: Build
  - stage: Deploy
```

---

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ `jobs`

- Each stage can have one or more jobs.
- Each job runs on **one agent**.

```yaml
jobs:
  - job: Compile
    pool:
      vmImage: "ubuntu-latest"
```

Jobs can also be:

- Conditional: `condition: eq(...)`
- Matrixed: run the same job with different inputs

---

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ `steps`

- Inside jobs.
- Each `step` is a command, task, or script.

```yaml
steps:
  - script: echo "Hello!"
  - task: NodeTool@0
    inputs:
      versionSpec: "18.x"
```

---

### 7Ô∏è‚É£ `tasks`

- Built-in or custom actions like `DotNetCoreCLI`, `PublishBuildArtifacts`, `AzureCLI`, etc.

Example:

```yaml
- task: AzureWebApp@1
  inputs:
    appName: "myapp"
    package: "$(Pipeline.Workspace)/app.zip"
```

üîé Find tasks in: [Azure DevOps Task Catalog](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/tasks/)

---

### 8Ô∏è‚É£ `pool`

Defines the agent that runs your jobs:

```yaml
pool:
  vmImage: "windows-latest"
```

Options:

- Microsoft-hosted agent pools
- Self-hosted agents

---

### 9Ô∏è‚É£ `condition`

Control execution of jobs or steps:

```yaml
condition: and(succeeded(), eq(variables['Build.SourceBranch'], 'refs/heads/main'))
```

---

### üîÅ Reusable YAML Features

- `extends`: Import templates
- `template`: Reuse jobs/stages/tasks across pipelines

```yaml
extends:
  template: my-template.yml
  parameters:
    environment: "prod"
```

## üìå Classic vs YAML - Environments & Deployment

| Feature               | Classic Editor     | YAML Pipeline           |
| --------------------- | ------------------ | ----------------------- |
| Editor Type           | GUI                | YAML as Code            |
| Deployment Target     | Deployment Group   | Environment             |
| Multi-Stage Support   | Not default        | Native                  |
| Templates/Reusability | Limited            | High (extends/template) |
| Version Control       | Not easily tracked | Versioned in Git        |

---

## üß† Tips for Writing YAML Pipelines

- ‚úÖ Use `steps.template.yml` for shared logic
- ‚úÖ Use variables for config like versions, envs
- ‚úÖ Leverage stages to separate build/test/deploy
- ‚úÖ Validate with `az pipelines validate`
- ‚úÖ Store secrets in variable groups or Key Vault

## üß™ YAML + Classic Combo?

Yes ‚Äî you can start with **Classic editor**, export as YAML, then enhance the YAML over time. Or, keep classic for deploys (CD), use YAML for CI. Flexible!
