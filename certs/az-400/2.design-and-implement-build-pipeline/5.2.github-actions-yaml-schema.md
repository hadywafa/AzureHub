# 🧬 GitHub Actions YAML Schema — Full Breakdown 🧪

> GitHub Actions uses YAML files to define workflows in `.github/workflows/`. This YAML file tells GitHub **what to run, when to run, and where to run**.

## 🧠 High-Level Schema Overview

```yaml
name: <workflow-name> # 👈 Optional name shown in GitHub UI
on: # 👈 Trigger section (event-based)
  push: # e.g. triggers on push
    branches: [main]
jobs: # 👈 Set of jobs (can run in parallel or sequentially)
  job-id: # 👈 Job name (identifier)
    name: Build My App # 👈 Optional display name
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest # 👈 Runner machine type
    steps: # 👈 Each step is a shell command or an action
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Run tests
        run: npm test
```

## 🔍 YAML Schema Fields Explained One by One

---

### 🏷 `name`

Gives your workflow a readable name in the GitHub Actions UI.

```yaml
name: 🚀 Build and Deploy Pipeline
```

---

### 🧨 `on` – Trigger Events

Tells GitHub **when to run this workflow**.

```yaml
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
  pull_request:
    branches: [develop]
  schedule:
    - cron: "0 0 * * 0" # Every Sunday
  workflow_dispatch: # Manual trigger button in GitHub UI
```

#### Supported Events:

| Event Type          | Description                                |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `push`              | On commit to a branch                      |
| `pull_request`      | On PR creation/update                      |
| `workflow_dispatch` | Manually triggered in UI                   |
| `schedule`          | Cron-based scheduling                      |
| `release`, `issues` | GitHub events (release, issue opened etc.) |

---

### 🧱 `jobs`

Defines **one or more jobs**. Each job runs on its own runner.

```yaml
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - run: echo "Build Job"
```

---

### 🆔 `job-id`

Job name (machine-readable, must be lowercase, no spaces):

```yaml
jobs:
  test-job:  # 👈 Job ID (used internally)
    name: Run Tests
    ...
```

---

### 🏃 `runs-on`

Specifies the **runner** environment (Linux, Windows, or macOS):

```yaml
runs-on: ubuntu-latest # or windows-latest, macos-latest
```

💡 You can also use self-hosted runners:

```yaml
runs-on: [self-hosted, linux]
```

---

### 💎 `needs` – Job Dependency

Make one job **wait** for another:

```yaml
jobs:
  build: ...
  test:
    needs: build # test runs *after* build completes
```

---

### 🧬 `steps`

Defines a list of **commands** or **actions** to execute.

```yaml
steps:
  - name: Checkout code
    uses: actions/checkout@v4

  - name: Run Tests
    run: npm test

  - name: Upload Artifact
    uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
    with:
      name: results
      path: ./results/
```

---

### 🎭 `uses` vs `run`

| Keyword | Purpose                        |
| ------- | ------------------------------ |
| `run`   | Runs a shell command           |
| `uses`  | Calls a reusable GitHub Action |

#### Example:

```yaml
- run: echo "Hello from shell"
- uses: actions/checkout@v4
```

---

### 🧰 `env` – Environment Variables

```yaml
env:
  NODE_ENV: production

steps:
  - run: echo "Environment = $NODE_ENV"
```

---

### 🧪 `outputs` – Pass Data Between Jobs

```yaml
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    outputs:
      artifact_path: ${{ steps.build.outputs.artifact }}
    steps:
      - id: build
        run: echo "artifact=build/output.zip" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT

  deploy:
    needs: build
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - run: echo "Deploying ${{ needs.build.outputs.artifact_path }}"
```

---

### 🔄 `strategy` – Matrix Builds

Used to run **multiple combinations** in parallel.

```yaml
strategy:
  matrix:
    node-version: [14, 16, 18]

steps:
  - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
    with:
      node-version: ${{ matrix.node-version }}
```

---

### 🧾 `with` – Pass Inputs to Actions

```yaml
- uses: actions/setup-node@v4
  with:
    node-version: 18
```

---

### 🔐 `secrets` – Secure Inputs

```yaml
- run: az login --service-principal ...
  env:
    AZURE_CREDENTIALS: ${{ secrets.AZURE_CREDENTIALS }}
```

Secrets are stored in:

> **Repo Settings → Secrets → Actions**

---

### ⚠️ `if` – Conditional Execution

```yaml
- name: Run only if on main
  if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
  run: echo "Deploying to Production!"
```

You can use:

- `github.event_name`, `github.actor`
- `success()`, `failure()`, `always()`

---

### 🔁 `timeout-minutes`

Set max time per job.

```yaml
jobs:
  build:
    timeout-minutes: 10
```

---

### 💥 `continue-on-error`

Don’t fail the workflow even if the step fails.

```yaml
- name: Try something risky
  run: risky-script.sh
  continue-on-error: true
```

---

### 📦 `artifacts` – Upload/Download Files

```yaml
- uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
  with:
    name: build-logs
    path: ./logs/
```

```yaml
- uses: actions/download-artifact@v4
  with:
    name: build-logs
```

---

### 🧪 `defaults` – Set Shell or Working Directory Globally

```yaml
defaults:
  run:
    shell: bash
    working-directory: ./src
```

---

## ✅ Full Sample Workflow

```yaml
name: CI Pipeline

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Setup Node
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: 18
      - name: Run Build
        run: npm run build
      - name: Upload Dist
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
        with:
          name: dist
          path: dist/
```
