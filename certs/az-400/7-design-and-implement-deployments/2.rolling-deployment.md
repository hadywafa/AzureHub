# 🔄 Rolling Deployments in Azure

## 📘 What is a Rolling Deployment?

A **rolling deployment** (aka Gradual Deployment) gradually replaces **old versions** of your application **with new ones**, one batch (or instance) at a time — **without downtime**.

Rather than replacing the entire environment (like Blue/Green), **a portion of the environment is updated**, verified, then the rest follows.

## 🧩 Key Components

| Component                       | Description                                                                       |
| ------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 🟦 **Production Environment**   | The currently live application running with real user traffic.                    |
| 🖥️ **Production Instances**     | Your app is deployed across **multiple instances** (VMs, containers, pods, etc.). |
| 🌐 **Routing and Connectivity** | A **load balancer** distributes traffic to all available (old or new) instances.  |

## ⚙️ How Rolling Deployments Work (Step-by-Step)

1. 💻 App is live on N instances (e.g., 4 web servers).
2. 🚀 One instance is stopped, updated, and restarted.
3. 🔁 Load balancer **temporarily removes** the instance from the routing pool.
4. 🔍 Health checks run on updated instance.
5. ✅ If healthy, repeat for the next batch.
6. 🆗 Once all instances are updated → deployment is complete.

## 💡 Azure Implementation Options

| Azure Service                      | Rolling Deployment Support                                                       |
| ---------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Azure App Service**              | Native rolling updates using deployment slots or App Service deployment settings |
| **AKS (Azure Kubernetes Service)** | Use **RollingUpdate** strategy in Kubernetes Deployments                         |
| **Azure VMSS** (Scale Sets)        | Native rolling upgrades via **update policy**                                    |
| **Azure DevOps**                   | Release pipelines support rolling strategies (esp. for VMSS, AKS)                |

## ✅ Pros and Considerations

| 👍 Pros                                         | ⚠️ Cons                                                         |
| ----------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ✅ **Zero Downtime**                            | ❗ **Complex Rollback**: Requires replacing all updated batches |
| 💵 **No Duplicate Cost**                        | 🔄 **Partial Updates**: Might mix old & new versions briefly    |
| 🪴 **Gradual Release**: Easy to monitor for bugs | ⏳ **Slower Deployment Time**                                   |
| 🔁 **No full duplication**                      | 🧪 Needs thorough **health checks** for each update phase       |

## 💬 Example: Rolling Deployment in AKS (Kubernetes)

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: my-app
spec:
  replicas: 4
  strategy:
    type: RollingUpdate
    rollingUpdate:
      maxUnavailable: 1
      maxSurge: 1
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: my-app
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: my-container
          image: myrepo/app:v2
```

- 🔄 `maxUnavailable: 1`: Only 1 instance can be down at a time.
- 🆕 `maxSurge: 1`: One extra pod can be added temporarily during update.
- This ensures **at least 3 of 4** pods are always available.

---

## 🧯 What if something goes wrong?

You must implement:

- **Readiness probes**: So the load balancer doesn't route traffic until the instance is ready.
- **Health checks**: Fail fast if the new version is broken.
- **Rollback strategy**: Revert the image version or config.

Example AKS rollback:

```bash
kubectl rollout undo deployment/my-app
```

## 🔚 Summary: When to Use Rolling Deployments?

| Use Case                            | Recommendation                  |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Want **zero downtime**?             | ✅ Yes                          |
| On a **large number of instances**? | ✅ Best suited                  |
| Want to **save cost**?              | ✅ No duplicate infra           |
| Need **fast rollback**?             | ❌ More complex than Blue/Green |
| Need **gradual rollout**?           | ✅ Preferred                    |
