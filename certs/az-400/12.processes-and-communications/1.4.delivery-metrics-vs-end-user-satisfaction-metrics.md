# 📊 Delivery Metrics vs 🎯 End-User Satisfaction Metrics

## ⚙️ Delivery Metrics (Azure DevOps Native)

These track **how well the team delivers software**. They are **internal DevOps process metrics**.

| Metric                          | What it Measures                               | Where it Comes From                           |
| ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| **Velocity**                    | Story points / work items completed per sprint | Azure Boards (Backlogs/Sprints)               |
| **Lead Time**                   | Time from idea → production                    | Boards + Pipelines                            |
| **Cycle Time**                  | Time from work started → completed             | Boards (work item analytics)                  |
| **MTTR (Mean Time to Restore)** | Avg. time to recover from failure              | Pipelines + Monitoring (App Insights, Alerts) |
| **Change Failure Rate**         | % of deployments that fail or cause incidents  | Pipelines + Release logs                      |

👉 **Use case:** “Are we delivering software fast, stable, and reliably?”

## 🎯 End-User Satisfaction Metrics (External, Integrated into ADO)

These track **how customers feel about the product**. They are **external business/customer metrics**.

| Metric                                     | What it Measures                  | Where it Comes From                     |
| ------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| **CSAT (Customer Satisfaction)**           | Short-term user happiness         | Surveys (SurveyMonkey, Dynamics, CRM)   |
| **NPS (Net Promoter Score)**               | Loyalty, willingness to recommend | Customer feedback tools                 |
| **CES (Customer Effort Score)**            | Ease of completing tasks          | Support follow-ups, in-app surveys      |
| **App Ratings & Reviews**                  | Public reputation                 | App Store, Play Store, Marketplace      |
| **Churn Rate**                             | % of users leaving                | CRM, analytics platforms                |
| **Support Metrics (FCR, Resolution Time)** | Service quality & frustration     | Zendesk, ServiceNow, Support dashboards |

👉 **Use case:** “Are customers happy with what we deliver?”

## 🔗 How They Tie Together in Azure DevOps

- 📊 **Dashboards & Widgets** → Combine delivery & satisfaction metrics side by side.
- 🔔 **Service Hooks** → Low NPS or CSAT can auto-create bugs/work items.
- 📈 **Analytics Views** → Correlate velocity/lead time with CSAT/NPS trends.
- 🔄 **DevOps Feedback Loop** → Delivery metrics prove _how we ship_, satisfaction metrics prove _if we shipped the right thing_.

## 🧠 Memory Hack

- **Delivery Metrics** = “How fast, stable, reliable is our pipeline?” (inside Azure DevOps).
- **Satisfaction Metrics** = “Are customers happy?” (outside → integrated into Azure DevOps).
