# 🌟 End-User Satisfaction Metrics in DevOps

## 🎯 Why They Matter

In DevOps, speed alone isn’t enough 🚀 — you must also prove that what you’re shipping actually makes **customers happy**.
That’s where **end-user satisfaction metrics** come in: they close the **feedback loop** in the DevOps lifecycle.

## 📊 The Key Metrics

### 1. 😊 CSAT (Customer Satisfaction Score)

- **What it is:** Short-term happiness after an interaction.
- **Scale:** 1–5 (or 1–10).
- **Formula:**

  $$
  \text{CSAT \%} = \frac{\text{\# satisfied responses}}{\text{total responses}} \times 100
  $$

- **Use case:** “Did users like this feature/release?”

---

### 2. 💡 NPS (Net Promoter Score)

- **What it is:** Loyalty + likelihood to recommend product.
- **Scale:** 0–10.
- **Groups:** Promoters (9–10), Passives (7–8), Detractors (0–6).
- **Formula:**

  $$
  \text{NPS} = \% \text{Promoters} - \% \text{Detractors}
  $$

- **Use case:** “Do users trust us long-term?”

---

### 3. 🔁 CES (Customer Effort Score)

- **What it is:** Ease of completing a task (support, checkout, feature use).
- **Scale:** 1–7 (1 = hard, 7 = easy).
- **Use case:** “Was it easy for the user to succeed?”

---

### 4. 📲 App Ratings & Reviews

- **What it is:** Public feedback via app stores, portals.
- **Scale:** ⭐ 1–5.
- **Use case:** Reputation health check.

---

### 5. 📉 Churn Rate (indirect)

- **What it is:** Percentage of customers who leave over time.
- **Formula:**

  $$
  \text{Churn Rate} = \frac{\text{Customers lost}}{\text{Customers at start}} \times 100
  $$

- **Use case:** “Are we losing customers due to dissatisfaction?”

---

### 6. 🎟️ Support Metrics (indirect)

- **Examples:** Ticket volume, resolution time, First Contact Resolution.
- **Use case:** High ticket spikes = unhappy customers.

## 🔗 How They Relate to Azure DevOps

Azure DevOps **doesn’t generate these metrics by itself**, but:

- 📊 **Dashboards** → can display CSAT/NPS from external systems (e.g., SurveyMonkey, Dynamics, Application Insights).
- 🔔 **Service Hooks** → low CSAT survey could trigger a **bug work item**.
- 📈 **Analytics Views** → combine delivery metrics (Velocity, Lead Time) with customer metrics (NPS, CSAT).
- 🔄 **Feedback Loop** → these metrics close the loop of _Plan → Build → Release → Monitor → Learn_.

👉 In exams, remember: **Delivery metrics** (Velocity, Lead Time, MTTR) are ADO-native,
while **Satisfaction metrics** (CSAT, NPS, CES) are customer-facing but integrated.
