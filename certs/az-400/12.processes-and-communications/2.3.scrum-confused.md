# 👀 **heart of Scrum confusion**

## 🎯 1. What are Story Points?

- **Story Points (SP)** are a **relative size/effort measure**, not hours.
- Teams use them to express how "big" or "complex" a backlog item is compared to others.

👉 Think of it like **weight classes in boxing**:

- P3 (3 SP) = featherweight (easy task).
- P1 (5 SP) = middleweight (average complexity).
- P5 (8 SP) = heavyweight (complex, risky).

⚡ **Key Rule:** SP don’t map directly to time → they reflect complexity, risk, and effort.

---

## 🧮 2. Why 18 Story Points in Sprint 1?

- The team estimated P1–P4 as **5+5+3+5 = 18 SP**.
- That’s their **Sprint Commitment**.
- If their team velocity (average SP completed per sprint) is \~18, then this is realistic.
- If it’s their **first sprint**, they start small and learn their velocity as they go.

👉 Yes, the **goal is to finish all 4 PBIs in Sprint 1**.
👉 If they fail, that’s fine → they learn their _real velocity_ for future sprints.

---

## 🧑‍💻 3. Do Developers Work on P1–P4 Simultaneously or One by One?

This is where Scrum gets misunderstood 👇

- **PBIs are broken into Tasks.**
- Different developers pick up **different tasks in parallel.**

Example:

| PBI                | Tasks                | Who might do it |
| ------------------ | -------------------- | --------------- |
| P1 Product List    | API for product list | Backend Dev     |
|                    | UI grid component    | Frontend Dev    |
|                    | Write test cases     | QA              |
| P2 Product Details | Product endpoint     | Backend Dev     |
|                    | Details page         | Frontend Dev    |
|                    | Automated test       | QA              |

👉 Work **flows in parallel**, but each PBI should be completed (from tasks → done) within the sprint.

---

## 🚦 4. What If Not All PBIs Can Be Delivered?

- Scrum isn’t about **perfect planning**.
- If P4 (View/edit cart) isn’t finished →

  - It goes back to the Product Backlog.
  - It can be re-planned for the next Sprint.

👉 Nothing is wasted → partially done work may be completed in Sprint 2.

---

## 🔄 5. What "Delivery" Means in Scrum

- You don’t deliver **all features at the end of the project**.
- You deliver **a working increment every Sprint**.

In Sprint 1, **if P1–P3 are done but P4 isn’t**, you still demo:

- ✅ Browse product list
- ✅ Product details
- ✅ Add to cart
- ❌ Cart editing (not ready yet)

👉 That’s still a **usable product increment** (customers can browse and add items, just can’t edit cart yet).

---

## 🧮 6. how to calculate velocity & sprint capacity in hours vs story points

### 👨🏻‍🔬 6.1 Sprint Capacity in Hours

Let’s assume:

- Sprint length = **2 weeks** (10 working days)
- Team size = **5 members**
- Each person → \~6 productive hours/day (meetings, breaks, emails eat the rest)

👉 Capacity per person = `10 days × 6h = 60h`
👉 Team total capacity = `60h × 5 = 300h`

So the team has about **300 effective hours** to deliver work in the Sprint.

---

### 📏 6.2 Why Not Estimate in Hours Directly?

- Hours feel “precise” but are misleading: people code at different speeds, blockers appear, complexity varies.
- **Story Points** measure **relative complexity** instead.

👉 Example:

- “Login page” is a 3 SP story.
- “Checkout with payment” feels about 3× harder → 8 SP.
- Points normalize across the team, not individuals.

---

### 🚀 6.3 Velocity: SP → Time

**Velocity** = how many SP a team _actually_ finishes in a Sprint.

Example:

- Sprint 1 → Team delivered 18 SP (P1–P3 done, P4 unfinished).
- Sprint 2 → They delivered 20 SP.
- Average velocity = \~19 SP.

👉 That means the team can safely **plan \~19 SP per Sprint** going forward.

---

### ⚡ 6.4 Mapping SP to Hours (approximate, never exact)

Some teams make a rough mapping (but avoid being rigid):

| SP  | Typical Relative Effort       | Approx Hours (team avg) |
| --- | ----------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| 1   | Trivial, tiny fix             | 2–4h                    |
| 2   | Small change                  | 6–10h                   |
| 3   | Medium story                  | 12–18h                  |
| 5   | Larger feature                | 20–30h                  |
| 8   | Complex/high-risk             | 40–60h                  |
| 13  | Too big for sprint → split it | > 60h                   |

⚠️ **Important:** SP are **not hours** → this table is just to check feasibility.

- If you planned **18 SP**, and that roughly maps to \~250–280h → it fits in your **300h capacity** → good plan.
- If it mapped to 500h → you overcommitted → reduce scope.

---

### 🔄 6.5 Parallel Work vs Sequential

- The team does **not** complete PBIs strictly one by one.
- Work is broken into **tasks** (API, UI, tests). Different people grab tasks from different PBIs in parallel.
- The goal is that **by Sprint end**, all tasks inside PBIs are finished, so the PBI is “Done.”

👉 Example:

- Backend dev works on P1 (API).
- Frontend dev works on P2 (UI).
- QA writes tests for P3.
- Meanwhile, Scrum Master ensures no blockers.

## ✅ Simple Analogy

Think of a **restaurant kitchen**:

- Order = PBI (e.g., “Burger meal”).
- Tasks = cooking burger, frying fries, pouring drink.
- Multiple chefs work **in parallel** on different orders.
- Some meals (PBIs) are ready before others → but all should ideally be served within 15 minutes (the Sprint).
- If fries aren’t ready → you serve what’s done, and fries roll into the next round.

---

## 💡 Recap

- **18 SP** = total complexity team commits for Sprint 1.
- Goal = finish all 4 PBIs (18 SP) in 2 weeks.
- Work is **parallel across tasks** inside PBIs.
- If some PBIs aren’t done → they roll over to the next Sprint.
- Each Sprint delivers a **usable increment**, not “everything at once.”
- **Capacity** = team hours available in Sprint.
- **Story Points** = relative complexity, not hours.
- **Velocity** = average SP completed per Sprint → used for planning.
- **Sprint Commitment** = sum of SP team believes fits capacity.
- Teams work on PBIs **in parallel (by tasks)**, not one at a time.
- Incomplete PBIs roll over → not a failure, but learning to refine velocity.
