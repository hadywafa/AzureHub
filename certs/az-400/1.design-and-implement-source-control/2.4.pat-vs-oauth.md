# 🔧 Problem: GCM Defaults to OAuth 😑

By default, **Git Credential Manager (GCM)** detects Azure DevOps and **prefers Microsoft Entra ID (OAuth)** for authentication — especially when it sees:

- A developer using Git CLI
- A corporate Microsoft account
- An interactive login

But for **automation, non-MFA users, or personal workflows**, you might want **PAT-only auth**.

---

## ✅ Solution: Use PAT Always (Bypass OAuth Login Flow)

There are **3 working methods** to ensure **Git uses your PAT always**:

---

## 🔐 ✅ Method 1: Use PAT as Password (Classic)

This is the most direct approach. GCM will **still store the PAT securely**, but **OAuth won't trigger**.

```bash
git clone https://dev.azure.com/org/project/_git/repo
```

When prompted:

```plaintext
Username: anything (e.g., your email or 'user')
Password: <paste your PAT>
```

🔒 GCM **detects the PAT** and stores it (instead of initiating OAuth flow).
✅ All future `git pull/push` will use **the stored PAT**.

> 💡 Pro Tip: Do this once and you're set (until the PAT expires).

---

## 🔄 ✅ Method 2: Preconfigure PAT in Git Credential Store

You can **manually store your PAT** into Git’s credential manager **before** Git ever prompts for OAuth.

```bash
# Replace with your actual org/project/repo
git credential-manager-core store
```

It will prompt:

```plaintext
protocol=https
host=dev.azure.com
username=anything
password=<paste your PAT>
```

Or store it non-interactively like this:

```bash
printf "protocol=https\nhost=dev.azure.com\nusername=anyuser\npassword=your_PAT_here\n" | \
git credential-manager-core store
```

✅ Now when you `git clone` or `git push`, Git will **reuse your PAT silently** without triggering OAuth.

---

## ❌ Bonus (Don’t Do): Disable GCM (not recommended unless scripting)

You **can** disable GCM entirely:

```bash
git config --global --unset credential.helper
```

Then Git will fall back to system prompts, and you'll need to enter the PAT manually each time.

✅ Good for **scripts**
❌ Bad for **developers** — no secure storage, no caching, annoying prompts

---

## ✅ Recap: Force Git to Use PAT Always

| Method               | Description                  | Recommended For             |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| 💬 Manual prompt     | Enter PAT once at clone time | ✅ Easy + secure            |
| 🗃️ Pre-store via GCM | Save PAT before clone        | ✅ Scripting, automation    |
| 🚫 Disable GCM       | Remove credential helper     | ⚠️ Not secure for daily use |

---

## 🧠 Final Tip: If You Already Logged in via OAuth…

To switch from OAuth to PAT:

1. Clear stored credentials:

   ```bash
   git credential-manager-core erase
   ```

2. Next Git command will prompt you.

3. Enter **anything as username**, and paste **your PAT as password**.

4. GCM stores the PAT securely. No OAuth this time.
