Great framing 👌 — you’re asking:
👉 *“How do I present myself so recruiters find me irresistible, and I don’t get boxed into the wrong bucket?”*

Let’s weigh the two branding options.

---

# 🟦 Option 1: **DevOps/SRE with Software Skills**

**Branding:** “I’m a DevOps/SRE who can also code and build tools.”

### ✅ Strengths

* Stands out in **ops-heavy markets** (UAE, Germany banking/telco).
* Companies struggling with Kubernetes/Terraform pipelines love DevOps with coding.
* Easier entry into **DevOps/SRE roles abroad** since your certs (AWS, Azure, Kubernetes, Terraform) directly map.

### ❌ Weaknesses

* Some recruiters **pigeonhole you as “ops only.”**
* FAANG recruiters may think: *“Not a core SWE → skip for backend SWE pipeline.”*
* Harder long-term pivot into **solution/enterprise architect** (cloud + AI side).

---

# 🟩 Option 2: **Software Engineer with Cloud/DevOps Skills**

**Branding:** “I’m a SWE who also knows how to run and scale what I build.”

### ✅ Strengths

* More attractive for **FAANG & product-company recruiters** (they screen SWE-first).
* Keeps path open to **architect roles** (Solution Architect, Enterprise Architect, Cloud Architect).
* Lets you pivot into **AI/data engineering** later — much harder from a pure DevOps profile.
* Recruiters love the **“full stack + cloud + DevOps”** combo — reads as *end-to-end builder*.

### ❌ Weaknesses

* Slightly harder to land **DevOps-only roles** in companies where “certs + infra” is the main filter.
* Requires you to **prove coding chops** (LeetCode, system design) in interviews.

# 🎯 Recruiter Psychology (what actually happens)

* If they see **“DevOps Engineer, RHCE, AWS, Terraform, Kubernetes”** → they slot you into **infra roles**.
* If they see **“Senior SWE (C#, Angular, Java) + AWS, Kubernetes, Terraform (certified)”** → they slot you into **backend/SWE roles**, but with a huge plus: you can own CI/CD, infra, and cloud-native deployments.

👉 Recruiters almost always **default to your main title** (SWE vs DevOps). Your *secondary skills* make you *stand out*, but your **primary label** determines the first filter.

# ✅ My Recommendation (for YOU)

Given your:

* SWE background (C#, Angular, strong coding)
* Cloud/SRE certs (AWS, Kubernetes, Terraform, Azure AI)
* Passion for **cloud + AI + architecture**

👉 Brand yourself as:
**“Software Engineer (Backend/Cloud) with strong DevOps/SRE expertise.”**

That way:

* In **UAE/Germany** → you’re competitive for SWE *and* DevOps/SRE roles.
* For **FAANG** → you don’t get stuck as “ops-only.”
* For **long-term architect path** → SWE-first branding keeps doors wide open.

# 🔑 Recruiter-Attractive Title Examples (for LinkedIn/CV)

* **“Senior Software Engineer | Cloud & DevOps | AWS & Kubernetes Certified”**
* **“Backend Software Engineer (Java/.NET) with Cloud & Reliability Expertise”**
* **“Software Engineer | Cloud Architect in Progress | AWS & Azure Certified”**

These scream *“I can code, I can scale, I can operate”* → recruiters love it.

---

✅ Bottom Line:
**SW with cloud/DevOps skills + certs** will make you more attractive to recruiters (both FAANG and international markets) than **DevOps with coding skills.**

👉 Do you want me to draft a **2-column comparison CV/LinkedIn branding** (SWE-first vs DevOps-first) so you can *see exactly how recruiters would read you*?
