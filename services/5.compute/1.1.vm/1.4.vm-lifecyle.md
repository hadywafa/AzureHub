# 🚀 **Azure Virtual Machine Lifecycle – Visual, Simple, and Complete**

> _Mastering the Azure VM lifecycle helps you avoid surprises with billing, state transitions, and resource behavior like resizing, shutdown, or deallocation._

## 🔄 **1. Starting (Provisioning)**

🟡 **State**: `Creating` / `Starting`
Azure is provisioning the VM resources — disks, NICs, storage, networking, metadata.

- ⏳ VM is being initialized
- 💸 **Billing**: _Not charged during this stage_

---

## 🟢 **2. Running (Allocated)**

🟢 **State**: `Running` (a.k.a. "allocated")
Your VM is now active, and you're charged for compute. You can SSH (Linux) or RDP (Windows) into it.

- ✅ Ready to accept workloads
- 💸 **Billing**:

  - ✅ **Compute charges** (based on VM size/hour)
  - ✅ **Disk/network charges**

---

## 🔁 **3. Restarting (Reboot)**

🔁 **State**: `Running`
This is a **soft reboot** (either from OS or portal/CLI). It **does not deallocate the VM**.

- 🔧 OS reboot, patch install, config update
- 💸 **Billing continues**, same as running

---

## 🛑 **4. Stopped vs Stopped (Deallocated)**

| **State**                  | ⚠️ Behavior                                            | 💸 **Billing**                           |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------- |
| 🟥 `Stopped`               | OS shutdown (via OS poweroff), **but still allocated** | ✅ Billed for compute                    |
| 🟡 `Stopped (Deallocated)` | VM is **fully deallocated**, compute resources freed   | ❌ No compute charge <br> ✅ Disk charge |

---

### 📌 **Deallocated = AWS Stopped**

> Azure charges **only for storage** when VMs are in **Stopped (Deallocated)** state.
> To stop billing, you must **explicitly deallocate** via portal or CLI.

---

## ❌ **5. Deleted (Terminated)**

❌ **State**: `Deleted`
The VM and its attached resources (if not retained) are removed.

- 🪓 Compute and memory gone
- 🧹 Managed disks may **persist** (you’re still billed)
- 💸 **Billing**:

  - ❌ No VM compute charge
  - ⚠️ **Disk/network charges may continue** if not cleaned up

---

## 🧊 **6. Azure Hibernate (Preview)**

Azure now supports **VM Hibernate** (in preview for specific VM series).

- 🧠 Saves RAM content to OS disk (like AWS Hibernate)
- 💾 Resume without full OS reboot
- 🔒 **OS disk must be encrypted**
- 💸 **Billing**:

  - ❌ No compute charge
  - ✅ Disk charge for memory snapshot

---

## ⚡ **7. Resizing Azure VM**

> Azure supports vertical scaling of VMs, but you must **deallocate** first (no live resize yet).

### 🔄 Resize Flow:

1. 🟡 **Deallocate the VM** (stopped, not just shut down)
2. 🛠️ Choose a new size from the allowed SKUs
3. 🟢 Start VM with new size

### 🔥 Resize Notes:

- Resize works only **within the same region**
- VM must be compatible with:

  - Current hardware cluster
  - Available quota

- Some SKUs may require a new placement on different hardware

---

## 🧯 **Shutdown Behavior in Azure**

### 📊 **Shutdown from inside OS**

When you run:

```bash
sudo shutdown now
```

Azure shuts down the OS, but **keeps the VM in `Stopped` (Allocated)\`** unless you check:

> 🔘 **"Deallocate this virtual machine when shutting down from inside"**

✅ You can configure this from:

- Azure Portal → VM → Auto-shutdown
- Azure CLI:

  ```bash
  az vm deallocate --name MyVM --resource-group MyRG
  ```

---

## 🔐 **Enable Delete Protection**

To avoid accidental deletion:

- Go to **VM → Settings → Configuration**
- Toggle **“Enable delete protection”**
- Prevents deletion via CLI or Portal

| Stage                        | Description                                     | Billed for Compute? |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| ✅ **Running**               | VM is active and ready                          | ✅ Yes              |
| 🔁 **Restarting (Reboot)**   | OS reboot or restart VM                         | ✅ Yes              |
| 🟥 **Stopped (Allocated)**   | OS-level shutdown, but still occupies resources | ✅ Yes              |
| 🟡 **Stopped (Deallocated)** | VM is fully stopped and compute released        | ❌ No               |
| ❌ **Deleted**               | VM and config removed (unless disks retained)   | ❌ No               |

| **VM State**              | **Compute Charges** | **Storage Charges (Disk)** |
| ------------------------- | ------------------- | -------------------------- |
| **Running**               | ✅ Yes              | ✅ Yes                     |
