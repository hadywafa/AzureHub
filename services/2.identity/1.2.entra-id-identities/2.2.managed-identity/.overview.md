# 🔍 What

Managed identities (both **system-assigned** and **user-assigned**) are essentially **specialized service principals** tied to Azure resources like VMs, App Services, or Functions. While they exist in Entra ID as identities, they’re designed for **authentication to Azure services**, not for group-based access control.

- **Managed identities are not user or device objects**, so they can't be added to security groups as members.
- You **can’t assign them to Entra ID roles or groups** directly.
- Their permissions are granted via **Azure RBAC**, not Entra group membership.
