# 💳 Azure Subscription

## 🧠 What’s an Azure Subscription?

A **subscription** in Azure is your **personal playground**, **billing wallet**, and **boundary of control**. It holds your cloud stuff (VMs, DBs, storage) and tracks what you use and pay.

> 📦 It's like a box — you fill it with cloud toys, and Azure sends the bill to that box.

---

## 👀 Why Does It Exist?

- 💸 **Billing Boundary** – Each subscription has its own invoice.
- 🔐 **Access Control** – You can assign different teams different access scopes.
- 🎯 **Resource Quota** – Limits like vCPU per region apply per subscription.

## 🔁 Where It Fits in Azure's Hierarchy

    A[Azure Account (e.g., user@domain.com)] --> B[Entra ID Tenant]
    B --> C[Optional: Management Group]
    C --> D[💳 Subscription]
    D --> E[📁 Resource Group]
    E --> F[🛠️ Resources (VMs, Storage, DBs)]
```

> 🤔 Compared to AWS: Azure **Subscription** ≈ AWS **Account**, but you can have many subscriptions under one tenant (unlike AWS).

## 🛠️ Real-World Use Cases

| Scenario          | Why Use Separate Subscriptions?               |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Dev/Test vs Prod  | Isolate workloads, avoid breaking prod 🚧     |
| Multi-department  | Finance and HR don't need to share toys       |
| Cost tracking     | Easier billing by project/team 🧾             |
| Security boundary | Apply stricter policies for sensitive data 🔐 |

## 🧾 Types of Subscriptions (a.k.a. "Ways to Pay")

| Plan                          | What It Offers                                          |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Free Trial**                | \$200 credit for 30 days + some free services           |
| **Pay-As-You-Go**             | Only pay for what you use (default for individuals)     |
| **Student**                   | Free credits, no credit card needed (lucky students 🎓) |
| **Enterprise Agreement (EA)** | Big orgs, big bills, big discounts                      |
| **CSP**                       | Cloud reseller model — good for partners                |

## 🔑 Access Control in a Subscription

Access = controlled using **RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)**.

| Role        | Permission                             |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Owner       | Full access, including managing access |
| Contributor | Do everything but can’t assign roles   |
| Reader      | Can only view stuff                    |

Assign roles at:

- Subscription level (broad)
- Resource group level (narrower)
- Individual resource level (surgical 🩺)

---

## ⚙️ How Do You Create a Subscription?

You’ll need to:

1. Be a **billing admin**.
2. Go to **Subscriptions** in Azure Portal.
3. Click **+ Add**.
4. Pick your offer (e.g., Pay-As-You-Go), tenant, and name.

Or use CLI if you’re feeling fancy:

```bash
az account subscription create --display-name "Marketing-Prod"
```

---

## 🧠 Example Scenario

> Let's say your org is **Contoso Ltd**.

You create:

- 🔹 **Contoso-Dev** subscription → for developers
- 🔹 **Contoso-Prod** → for live customer-facing apps
- 🔹 **Contoso-Finance** → isolated for compliance

Each one:

- Has its own **billing report**
- Has different **RBAC assignments**
- Still uses same **Entra ID (Tenant)**

## 🚧 Subscription Limits & Quotas

| Resource        | Default Limit (per region) |
| --------------- | -------------------------- |
| vCPUs           | 10–20                      |
| Resource Groups | 980                        |
| Public IPs      | 20                         |
| VNets           | 100                        |

Need more? File a quota request (no drama, just clicks).

## 🔄 Can You Have Multiple Subscriptions?

YES. And you should.

Why?

- 🧼 Clean separation
- 🎯 Targeted policies (e.g., only prod gets premium storage)
- 💸 Easier budget tracking
