# üß≠ NSG Destination Options in Azure

In Azure, **NSG (Network Security Group) rules** control traffic **based on source and destination criteria** ‚Äî and one of the most powerful parts is how you define the **destination**. In this guide, we'll deep dive into **destination types** for NSG rules, how to use them, and **real-world examples** to show their flexibility.

## üî∞ NSG Rule Destination Options

Azure supports **three types** of destinations in NSG rules:

| Type                                      | Syntax Format                | Description                                                             |
| ----------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| üß± **IP Address/Range**                   | `10.0.0.4` / `10.0.0.0/24`   | Specific IP address or range of IPs (CIDR)                              |
| üè∑Ô∏è **Service Tags**                       | `VirtualNetwork`, `Internet` | Predefined Azure labels that represent entire services or IP blocks     |
| üßø **Application Security Groups (ASGs)** | Name of the ASG              | Logical group of NICs in the same VNet. Useful for dynamic environments |

---

## üß± 1. Destination: IP Addresses and Ranges

- **Use Case**: Classic control of network access using known IPs.
- **Examples**:

```plaintext
Destination = 10.0.0.10         # Single VM
Destination = 10.0.1.0/24       # Subnet
Destination = 172.16.0.0/16     # Entire CIDR range
```

**Sample Rule**:

```json
{
  "name": "AllowWebSubnet",
  "priority": 100,
  "direction": "Inbound",
  "access": "Allow",
  "protocol": "TCP",
  "sourceAddressPrefix": "*",
  "sourcePortRange": "*",
  "destinationAddressPrefix": "10.0.1.0/24",
  "destinationPortRange": "80,443"
}
```

## üè∑Ô∏è 2. Destination: Service Tags

- **What are they?** Abstract labels managed by Microsoft that map to Azure services' IP ranges.
- **Why Use?** Reduce complexity. No need to manage or update public IPs of services.
- **Examples**:

| Service Tag         | Description                               |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `VirtualNetwork`    | The entire VNet                           |
| `Internet`          | Any IP not in Azure (public internet)     |
| `AzureLoadBalancer` | Azure health probes and LB traffic        |
| `Storage`           | Azure Blob/File/Queue/Table Storage       |
| `AzureSQL`          | Azure SQL Database endpoints              |
| `AppGateway`        | Azure Application Gateway backend traffic |

**Sample Rule** ‚Äì Allow outbound to Azure SQL only:

```json
{
  "name": "AllowAzureSQL",
  "priority": 100,
  "direction": "Outbound",
  "access": "Allow",
  "protocol": "TCP",
  "sourceAddressPrefix": "*",
  "destinationAddressPrefix": "AzureSQL",
  "destinationPortRange": "1433"
}
```

> üîÅ **Service Tags** automatically update in the background ‚Äî no maintenance needed.

---

## üßø 3. Destination: Application Security Groups (ASGs)

- **What are they?** Named groups that reference the **Network Interfaces (NICs)** of VMs.
- **Why Use?** Enables dynamic grouping and logic-based rule targeting.

### üß± Use Case Example

Group all **web servers** in `WebASG`, all **database servers** in `DbASG`, and allow only port `1433` from WebASG ‚Üí DbASG.

```json
{
  "name": "AllowSQL",
  "priority": 200,
  "direction": "Inbound",
  "access": "Allow",
  "protocol": "TCP",
  "sourceApplicationSecurityGroups": [
    {
      "id": "/subscriptions/.../resourceGroups/.../providers/Microsoft.Network/applicationSecurityGroups/WebASG"
    }
  ],
  "destinationApplicationSecurityGroups": [
    {
      "id": "/subscriptions/.../resourceGroups/.../providers/Microsoft.Network/applicationSecurityGroups/DbASG"
    }
  ],
  "destinationPortRange": "1433"
}
```

### ‚úÖ Key ASG Rules

- All ASG-bound NICs must be in the **same VNet**.
- You can mix **IP**, **ASG**, and **Service Tag** destinations across different rules.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Mixed Destination Examples

### Example: Allow Internal App to Access SQL + Azure Storage

```json
[
  {
    "name": "AllowSQL",
    "priority": 100,
    "direction": "Outbound",
    "access": "Allow",
    "protocol": "TCP",
    "destinationAddressPrefix": "AzureSQL",
    "destinationPortRange": "1433"
  },
  {
    "name": "AllowStorage",
    "priority": 110,
    "direction": "Outbound",
    "access": "Allow",
    "protocol": "TCP",
    "destinationAddressPrefix": "Storage",
    "destinationPortRange": "443"
  }
]
```

## ‚úÖ Summary Table

| Destination Type           | Use When...                                       | Pros                           | Notes                           |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ | ------------------------------- |
| IP Address / CIDR          | You know exact IPs or ranges                      | Precise control                | Requires maintenance            |
| Service Tag                | You want to allow Azure services like SQL/Storage | No need to update IPs manually | Managed by Microsoft            |
| Application Security Group | You're grouping VMs dynamically by role/function  | Logical, scalable, flexible    | Only works within the same VNet |

---

## üß† Final Tip

You can **combine all destination types** in different rules within the same NSG to achieve powerful, readable, and maintainable configurations.
