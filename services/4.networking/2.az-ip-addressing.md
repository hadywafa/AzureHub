# üåê Azure IP Addressing

Azure IP addressing enables secure communication between resources inside a VNet and with the outside world. It‚Äôs split into two major categories:

- üõ°Ô∏è **Private IP Addressing** ‚Äì For internal traffic within Azure
- üåç **Public IP Addressing** ‚Äì For reaching or being reached from the internet

Let‚Äôs break them down and then go deep into **outbound connectivity options** like NAT Gateway and Load Balancer SNAT.

## üõ°Ô∏è Private IP Addressing

> A **Private IP address** is used for communication between Azure resources inside a Virtual Network (VNet).  
> It‚Äôs non-routable on the public internet.

### üìå **1. Association**

- **VMs use NICs**: Each Virtual Machine (VM) is assigned one or more private IPs through its **Network Interface (NIC)**.
- Azure **VM** can multiple **NIC**, but **NIC** can attach to **only one** **VM**.
- **PaaS resources & appliances**: Azure services like **Load Balancer**, **Application Gateway**, or **Private Link endpoints** also use private IPs, configured via resource settings.

### üìå **2. Allocation Types**

| Mode        | Behavior                                            | Use Case                     |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| **Dynamic** | Automatically assigned from the subnet pool         | Short-lived or stateless VMs |
| **Static**  | Manually assigned and reserved for the NIC/resource | DNS-registered apps, DBs     |

> üß† Static = persistent across reboots. Dynamic = released if NIC is deleted.

---

### üìå **3. Reserved Addresses**

Each Azure subnet reserves 5 IPs:

| Reserved For          | IP in CIDR `/24` Example |
| --------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Network address       | `.0`                     |
| Azure default gateway | `.1`                     |
| Azure DNS (if used)   | `.2`                     |
| Future use            | `.3`                     |
| Broadcast (reserved)  | `.255`                   |

---

## üåç Public IP Addressing

> A **Public IP address** enables your Azure resource (VM, Load Balancer, VPN Gateway, etc.) to send/receive traffic to/from the internet.

---

<div align="center">
  <img src="images/az-public-ip.png" alt="Public IP Address" style="width: 100%; border-radius: 10px; border: 2px solid white;">
</div>

---

### üìå **1. Association**

- Public IPs are **independent Azure resources** and must be:

  - Attached to **NICs**, **Azure Load Balancers**, or **VPN Gateways**

- Types:

  - **Basic**: No zone redundancy, open to all
  - **Standard**: Secure by default, zone-redundant, required for NAT Gateway

---

### üìå **2. Allocation Types**

| Mode        | Behavior                                          | Use Case                       |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| **Dynamic** | Assigned at runtime (IP can change)               | Dev/test or short-lived apps   |
| **Static**  | Reserved during provisioning and remains constant | Production, DNS, IP allowlists |

---

### üìå **3. Source Pools**

Public IPs can be sourced from:

- **Azure global IP pool**
- **Public IP Prefix** (your reserved block)
- **BYOIP** (Bring Your Own IP range)

## üöÄ Outbound Connectivity ‚Äì Options & Architecture

Outbound connectivity is how Azure resources initiate communication to the internet. Let‚Äôs explore the **4 major patterns** in Azure.

---

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ No Public IP (Default Outbound Access)

<div align="left">
  <img src="images/az-outbound-default.png" alt="Default Outbound Access" style="width: 80%; border-radius: 10px; border: 2px solid white; margin: 0 40px">
</div>

- **When?** A VM has no Public IP, no NAT Gateway, no Load Balancer.
- **How?** Azure assigns a **default ephemeral public IP**.
- **Limitations**:

  - IP is not guaranteed or consistent.
  - No DNS reverse mapping or allowlist compatibility.
  - No control or visibility into traffic.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Suitable only for short-lived traffic like downloading packages during bootstrapping.

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ VM with Public IP

<div align="left">
  <img src="images/az-outbound-public-ip.png" alt="VM Public IP" style="width: 80%; border-radius: 10px; border: 2px solid white; margin: 0 40px;">
</div>

- **Public IP attached to the NIC**
- **Outbound + inbound** traffic flows via this IP
- **Static IP strongly recommended** for:

  - External integrations
  - DNS mappings
  - Inbound access (web apps, SSH, RDP)

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Public IP With Load Balancer SNAT

<div align="left">
  <img src="images/az-outbound-lb-snat.png" alt="SNAT with Load Balancer" style="width: 80%; border-radius: 10px; border: 2px solid white; margin: 0 40px">
</div>

- Azure Load Balancer supports **Source NAT (SNAT)**:

  - Translates backend VM‚Äôs private IP to the LB‚Äôs public IP

- Requires **Outbound Rules** configuration

#### üîç Key Concepts:

| Feature             | Description                                             |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| **SNAT**            | Maps VM‚Äôs private IP + port ‚Üí LB‚Äôs public IP + new port |
| **Port exhaustion** | Too many VMs sharing one IP ‚Üí run out of ports          |
| **Manual scaling**  | Add outbound rules + extra IPs to scale SNAT pools      |
| **Use case**        | Shared public IP, low-to-medium outbound traffic        |

---

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ NAT Gateway (Recommended)

> A **NAT Gateway** is Azure‚Äôs best-practice outbound connectivity method for private subnets.

<div align="left">
  <img src="images/az-outbound-nat.png" alt="NAT Gateway" style="width: 80%; border-radius: 10px; border: 2px solid white; margin: 0 40px">
</div>

---

| Feature                      | Description                                  |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| **Managed service**          | Deployed separately, associated with subnets |
| **Uses Public IP or Prefix** | Can use 1 IP or a /29, /28 block             |
| **Many-to-One SNAT**         | Many VMs ‚Üí One public IP                     |
| **Consistent outbound IP**   | Good for IP allowlisting                     |
| **High-scale and zonal**     | Zone-redundant and scalable by default       |

> üß† Unlike SNAT on Load Balancer, NAT Gateway auto-scales and handles port exhaustion better.

---

## ü•ä SNAT (LB) vs NAT Gateway ‚Äì Quick Comparison

| Feature       | Load Balancer SNAT                | NAT Gateway                         |
| ------------- | --------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Resource Type | Part of Public Load Balancer      | Standalone Azure resource           |
| IP Assignment | Uses Load Balancer‚Äôs Public IP    | Uses attached Public IP(s)/Prefix   |
| Scalability   | Manual SNAT port scaling          | Auto-scale with port pre-allocation |
| Configuration | Requires outbound rules           | Simpler: just associate to subnet   |
| Use Case      | Load-balanced VMs with basic SNAT | High-scale outbound traffic         |

---

## üéØ Choosing the Right Outbound Model

| Scenario                      | Recommended Option        |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Short-lived script downloads  | Default outbound access   |
| Public-facing web server      | Public IP (NIC or LB)     |
| App with predictable IP needs | Static Public IP          |
| Scalable microservices        | NAT Gateway               |
| Shared IP for several VMs     | Load Balancer with SNAT   |
| IP allowlist integration      | Static IP via NAT Gateway |

---

## ‚úÖ Summary ‚Äì Best Practices

| Area           | Recommendation                                      |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Private IPs    | Use static IPs for databases and DNS-bound services |
| Public IPs     | Use Standard SKU + Static for production workloads  |
| Default Access | Avoid for production; use only for dev/test         |
| NAT Gateway    | Use for scalable, secure, and consistent outbound   |
| SNAT           | Good when combined with Load Balancer scenarios     |

---

## üß† Final Thoughts

- Azure IP architecture is **modular**: choose only what you need.
- **Default outbound access is fragile** ‚Äî don‚Äôt rely on it for anything important.
- Use **NAT Gateway** when in doubt ‚Äî it‚Äôs reliable, scalable, and simple.
- Treat **Public IPs as resources**, not properties. You can swap, move, or manage them independently.
