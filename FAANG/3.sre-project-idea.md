Absolutely! Here's the **English version** of your FAANG-level **SRE Personal Project Template** — designed to make your CV stand out and give you real confidence in interviews 🔥

# 🛠️ SRE Personal Project Template

**Project Name:** `ReliableApp – End-to-End SRE Demo Platform`

---

## 🔍 Overview

> **Goal:**
> Build a small but realistic microservice-based web app deployed on Kubernetes, with full observability, incident simulation, auto-healing, and root cause documentation — just like an SRE would manage in a real production system.

> **Purpose:**
> This is your chance to act like a real **SRE**:

* Set up **Monitoring + Alerting**
* Simulate **failures**
* Configure **auto-recovery**
* Define **SLIs / SLOs**
* Document **postmortems**

And yes — it will look amazing on your GitHub and CV!

## 📦 What You'll Build

### 1️⃣ Application Layer

* A simple **Python Flask** or **Node.js** app:

  * Homepage (`/`)
  * Slow endpoint (`/slow`)
  * Health check endpoint (`/health`)
  * Custom metrics endpoint (`/metrics`)

✅ Store in `app/`

---

### 2️⃣ Infrastructure

* Use **Docker Compose** locally
* Or deploy on **Kubernetes** (Minikube, GKE, EKS)
* Infrastructure provisioned via **Terraform**

✅ Terraform: `terraform/`
✅ K8s manifests: `k8s/`

---

### 3️⃣ CI/CD Pipeline

* Use **GitHub Actions** to:

  * Lint and test
  * Build Docker image
  * Push to DockerHub
  * Auto-deploy to Kubernetes

✅ CI/CD YAML: `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`

---

### 4️⃣ Observability

* **Prometheus** for metrics scraping
* **Grafana** for dashboards
* **Alertmanager** for notifications (Slack/email/etc.)
* Visualize:

  * Response times
  * Error rate
  * Pod health
  * Uptime

✅ Dashboards/config in `monitoring/`

---

### 5️⃣ Incident Simulation

* Simulate real outages:

  * Kill pods (`kubectl delete pod`)
  * Inject latency (`sleep()` or `tc qdisc`)
  * Break DB connection

🔥 Result:

* Prometheus detects issue
* Alerts fire
* App restarts if needed
* You write a **postmortem** after the incident

---

### 6️⃣ Auto-Healing & Resilience

* Kubernetes `livenessProbe`, `readinessProbe`, and `restartPolicy`
* Add **Horizontal Pod Autoscaler** for stress testing

✅ YAML in: `k8s/webapp-deployment.yaml`

---

### 7️⃣ SLIs & SLOs

* **Example SLO:** 99.9% of requests succeed within 300ms
* **Example SLI:** (Successful requests / Total requests)
* Use **Prometheus + Grafana** to monitor
* Add dashboards and alerts based on those values

✅ Define in `slo-sli/slo.md`

---

### 8️⃣ Postmortems

* Simulate an outage
* Write a postmortem with:

  * What happened
  * Root cause
  * Timeline
  * Fix
  * Preventative actions

✅ Markdown format in: `postmortems/incident-001.md`

---

## 📄 Example How to Write on CV

> **SRE Personal Project – ReliableApp**
> • Designed and deployed a production-simulated system with full observability and alerting using Prometheus, Grafana, and Alertmanager on Kubernetes.
> • Simulated failures and implemented auto-recovery mechanisms via liveness probes and HPA.
> • Defined SLIs/SLOs and wrote root-cause postmortems for outages.
> • CI/CD implemented with GitHub Actions and Terraform provisioning.
