## üõ†Ô∏è How to Use These for Mastery (Study Plan)

1. **Pick one book per domain + one course**

   * For Linux internals: *Understanding the Linux Kernel* + linux-insides
   * For systems APIs: *The Linux Programming Interface*
   * For distributed systems: a course (e.g. Columbia, or distributed systems course) plus *Designing Data-Intensive Applications* (if you add that)

2. **Code & experiment as you read**

   * Write small kernel modules
   * Trace system calls (`strace`), profile with `perf`
   * Build a toy distributed system (chat app, key-value store) and simulate failures

3. **Simulate failures / chaos engineering**

   * Kill nodes, inject latency, drop packets (use `tc`, `netem`)
   * Break parts of your system intentionally and recover

4. **Read postmortems / incident reports**

   * Google SRE book, published outages, team blogs
   * Analyze: what failed, root cause, mitigation, what automation could have prevented it

5. **Teach / write about what you learn**

   * Blog a small subsystem
   * Explain a failure scenario & how you'd debug
   * Contribute to linux-insides or an open source subsystem
