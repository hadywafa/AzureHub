That’s a **really smart observation** — and your concern is valid. The post you shared reflects a real trap some people fall into when moving into SRE: **getting typecast as “ops-heavy” instead of “engineering-heavy.”** Let’s analyze your situation with your background in mind 👇

# 🔎 Reality Check: SRE Career Risks

1. **SRE roles at FAANG**

   - Inside FAANG, SREs are treated as engineers, but **the skill branding outside is tricky**.
   - Hiring managers often see “SRE” as _ops_, not SWE → making it harder to pivot back into software roles.

2. **Enterprise / non-FAANG (Germany, UAE, GCC)**

   - Many companies in Europe and the Middle East want **DevOps/SRE as infra caretakers**: CI/CD, Kubernetes, monitoring, not deep coding.
   - Your fear: you could get boxed into “ops work” and lose traction in SWE/system design.

3. **Job market climate**

   - Right now, employers have the luxury of hiring an “exact match.”
   - SREs who rely on **internal-only tools (Google Borg, Google Monarch, etc.)** can look “non-transferable.”
   - That’s the pain point the post you shared describes.

# 👤 Your Profile Context (from memory)

- **Senior Full Stack Developer (.NET + Angular)** with years of coding experience.
- Strong **cloud certs** (AWS SAA/DVA, Kubernetes, Terraform, Azure AI, etc.).
- Recently upskilled into **DevOps/SRE territory** (K8s, Terraform, CI/CD, monitoring).
- Target: Move to **Dubai/Germany** → first get a stable role, then move toward **AI/data engineering** long term.

So you’re **not an SRE by history** — you’re a SWE who’s learning SRE tooling. That’s a huge advantage, but you need to **brand it carefully**.

# 🛤️ Two Roads You Can Take

## 🟦 Path 1: **SRE/DevOps Track**

- **Pros**:

  - High demand in UAE/Germany for cloud/Kubernetes/Terraform/SRE roles.
  - Your certs and new skills align perfectly.
  - Easier entry into multinational companies (banks, airlines, telcos).

- **Cons**:

  - Risk of being pigeonholed as “ops” if you don’t keep coding sharp.
  - Harder to re-enter **pure SWE roles** later (like that Google ex-SRE story).
  - Some FAANG-style interviews won’t consider SRE enough for SWE pipelines.

✅ If you pick this: Position yourself as **“Software Engineer with DevOps/SRE specialization”**, not “Ops guy.” Keep coding (LeetCode + system design) active.

## 🟩 Path 2: **Stay SWE, Add Reliability as a Skill**

- **Pros**:

  - Your full-stack background is directly marketable (Dubai loves Java/.NET + React/Angular).
  - Reliability/DevOps becomes your **secondary strength** → you stand out compared to pure SWE.
  - Easier to pivot into AI/data engineering later, since SWE → Data/Solutions path is smoother than Ops → Data.

- **Cons**:

  - Slightly harder to land “SRE-only” jobs if you want Google/Amazon SRE specifically.
  - You’ll compete with stronger Java candidates in Germany/Dubai, since .NET isn’t the #1 stack.

✅ If you pick this: Focus on **Java/Spring Boot + Kubernetes + Cloud**. That positions you as a **modern backend SWE who can also do DevOps/SRE** → way more marketable abroad.

# 🌍 Germany vs UAE Angle

- **Germany**: More rigid → SWE jobs prefer **Java + strong coding + system design**. SRE jobs are infra-heavy, not always coding.
- **UAE**: More flexible → many companies value **certs + multi-skill engineers**. They’ll gladly take someone who can code and run infra. Easier to enter as **DevOps/SRE** and then pivot inside.

# ✅ My Advice (Tailored for You)

Given your goals and background:

1. **Don’t lock yourself into SRE only.**
   Keep your branding as **“Senior SWE with strong DevOps/SRE skills.”** That keeps both doors open.

2. **For UAE:**

   - Target **DevOps/SRE roles** → they value certs and hybrid skills.
   - Use your full-stack + cloud background to stand out.

3. **For Germany:**

   - Strengthen **Java/Spring Boot + system design + algorithms**.
   - Target backend SWE first, use SRE as a bonus skill.

4. **Ongoing prep:**

   - Keep doing **LeetCode + system design** → avoid the “too ops” trap.
   - Keep Linux/distributed troubleshooting sharp (for SRE credibility).
   - Build a **personal project repo** (SWE + SRE combined: e.g., deploy a microservice with Kubernetes, CI/CD, monitoring).

# 🔑 Bottom Line

- **If you go pure SRE → risk being branded “ops” later.**
- **If you stay SWE with DevOps/SRE flavor → maximum flexibility.**

👉 My recommendation for you:
➡️ **Brand yourself as SWE (Java/.NET) with strong DevOps/SRE skills.**
➡️ In **UAE**, apply broadly (SWE + SRE).
➡️ In **Germany**, focus SWE, but highlight your reliability/infra chops.

That way you avoid the trap of that Google ex-SRE post.
