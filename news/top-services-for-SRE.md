# **Site Reliability Engineer (SRE)** on Azure

You need to master services that span **observability, automation, resilience, and scalability** — both conceptually and hands-on.

Here’s a modular roadmap tailored to your goals:

---

## 🧠 Core Azure Services to Master for SRE

### 🔧 1. **Azure Monitor + Log Analytics**

- **Concept**: Unified observability — metrics, logs, traces
- **Implementation**: Set up custom dashboards, KQL queries, alerts, and diagnostic settings
- **Why**: It’s your eyes and ears across distributed systems

---

### 🔧 2. **Azure Application Insights**

- **Concept**: Deep app-level telemetry (requests, dependencies, exceptions)
- **Implementation**: Instrument Node.js, C#, or containerized apps with SDKs or auto-injection
- **Why**: Enables performance tuning and root cause analysis

---

### 🔧 3. **Azure Container Apps (ACA) + Dapr**

- **Concept**: Serverless containers with built-in scaling, retries, and sidecar patterns
- **Implementation**: Deploy microservices with autoscaling, observability, and secure secrets
- **Why**: ACA abstracts away infra but gives you SRE-grade control

---

### 🔧 4. **Azure Functions + Durable Functions**

- **Concept**: Event-driven and orchestrated workflows
- **Implementation**: Build resilient pipelines with retries, timeouts, and stateful orchestration
- **Why**: Perfect for automation, alerting, and remediation

---

### 🔧 5. **Azure Key Vault + Managed Identity**

- **Concept**: Secrets management and identity-based access
- **Implementation**: Securely inject secrets into apps, rotate keys, enforce RBAC
- **Why**: SREs must eliminate hardcoded secrets and legacy shortcuts

---

### 🔧 6. **Azure Policy + Azure Resource Graph**

- **Concept**: Governance and compliance at scale
- **Implementation**: Enforce tagging, SKU limits, region restrictions; query resources across subscriptions
- **Why**: Prevent drift and enforce reliability standards

---

### 🔧 7. **Azure DevOps or GitHub Actions**

- **Concept**: CI/CD pipelines with infrastructure-as-code
- **Implementation**: Deploy Bicep/Terraform, run health checks, auto-rollbacks
- **Why**: SREs own the release process and its reliability

---

### 🔧 8. **Azure Load Balancer + Traffic Manager + Front Door**

- **Concept**: Multi-layer traffic routing and failover
- **Implementation**: Configure geo-routing, health probes, and backend pools
- **Why**: Critical for high availability and disaster recovery

---

### 🔧 9. **Azure Chaos Studio**

- **Concept**: Fault injection and resilience testing
- **Implementation**: Simulate outages, latency, and resource failures
- **Why**: SREs must test how systems behave under stress

---

### 🔧 10. **Azure Automation + Logic Apps**

- **Concept**: Scheduled and event-driven remediation
- **Implementation**: Auto-restart services, rotate secrets, clean up resources
- **Why**: Reduces toil and enforces reliability through automation

---

## 🧭 How to Learn: Concept → Implementation → Portfolio

For each service:

1. **Understand the “why”** — what problem it solves in SRE
2. **Build a hands-on demo** — deploy, monitor, break, and fix
3. **Document it** — create a LinkedIn post or GitHub README that explains the architecture, failure modes, and recovery
